# 1. Overview

In this project, I have implemented a classifier using deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks and transfer learning to classify traffic signs. I have trained a model so that it can decode traffic signs from natural images by using the German Traffic Sign Dataset. After the model is trained, I have tested my model program on new images of traffic signs collected from the web.

The steps of this project are the following:

- Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
- Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
- Design, train and test a model architecture
- Use the model to make predictions on new images
- Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
- Summarize the results with a written report

# 2. Data Set Summary & Exploration

This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32.

## Provide a basic summary of the data set

I used the numpy library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic signs data set:

- The size of training set is 34799
- The size of validation set is 4410
- The size of test set is 12630
- The shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32, 3)
- The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

## Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset 

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It pulls in a random set of 5 images.

I also detail the dataset structure by plotting the occurrence of each image class to get an idea of how the data is distributed.

# 3. Design and Test a Model Architecture

My final model consisted of the following layers:

|Layer|Description|
|:---------------   |:------------------------------------------------------------- |
|Input              |32x32x3 RGB image                                                  |
|Convolution 5x5    |2x2 stride, valid padding, outputs 28x28x6|
| RELU              ||
| Max pooling   | 2x2 stride, outputs 14x14x6|
| Convolution 5x5   |2x2 stride, valid padding, outputs 10x10x16|
| RELU  ||
| Max pooling   |2x2 stride, outputs 5x5x6|
| Fully connected |input 400, output 120|
| RELU  ||
| Dropout       | 50% keep                  |
| Fully connected   | input 120, output 84 |
| RELU  ||
| Dropout | 50% keep |
|Fully connected| input 84, output 43 |

To train the model, I used an LeNet for the most part that was given, but I added a dropout function for deleteing the fully connected layer's output. I used the AdamOptimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. The epochs used was 30 while the batch size was 64. Other important parameters I learned were important was the number and distribution of additional data generated. 

**My final model results were:**

- Train Accuracy = 0.999
- Valid Accuracy = 0.968
- Test Accuracy = 0.946

# 4. Test a Model on New Images

Here are five German traffic signs that I found on the web:

The model was able to correctly guess 8 of the 8 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 100%.

For the first image, the model is relatively sure that this is a Bumpy road (probability of 0.996), and the image does contain a bumpy road. The top 3 soft max probabilities were:

|Probability            |     Prediction                                | 
|:---------------------|:---------------------------------------------| 
|0.9967528          | Bumpy Road                                    | 
|0.0015             | Bicycles crossing                             |
|0.0013             | Traffic signals                               |
