这部分暂时不重要，先pass，有时间了，把Github的整理学下.
> If you are unfamiliar with GitHub , Udacity has a brief [GitHub tutorial](http://blog.udacity.com/2015/06/a-beginners-git-github-tutorial.html) to get you started. Udacity also provides a more detailed free [course on git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775). To learn about REAMDE files and Markdown, Udacity provides a free course on READMEs, as well. GitHub also provides a tutorial about creating Markdown files.
