# 2. what will you learn?

The main sections of the Apollo open-source self-driving car platform:
- high-definition map, High-definition maps underpin almost every other part of the software stack
- localization, how the car determines its location in the world
- perception, how a self-driving car sees the world, classification,detection, and segmentation
- prediction, how other vehicles or pedestrians might move
- planning, how to combine prediction and routing to generate a trajectory for our vehicle
- control, how to use steering, throttle, and brake to execute our planned trajectory

# 3. What is self-driving?

- Why do we need self-driving cars?

Apollo’s system centers around HD Maps and Localization. The other components of the system revolve around Perception, Prediction, Planning and Control, as we’ll see throughout this course.
