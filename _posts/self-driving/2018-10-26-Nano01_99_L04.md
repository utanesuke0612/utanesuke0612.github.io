# 1. Intro to Control Flow

C++ has several control flow options.
- if-else statements
- for loops
- while loops
- switch statements

# 2. Relational Operators

下面代码的写法很有意思，借鉴：

```c
/*Goal: learn if-else statements in C++*/

#include<iostream>
#include<string>

int main()
{
    //instead of printing 0 and 1, create an array where 
    //0 = False, 1 = True
    std::string TorF[] = {"False", "True"};
    
    int a = 100;
    int b = 33;
    int c = 33;
    
    //Print out the string values of each relational operation
    std::cout<<"a < b is "<<TorF[a<b];
    std::cout<<"\na > b is "<<TorF[a>b];
    std::cout<<"\na != b is "<<TorF[a!=b];
    std::cout<<"\nc >= b is "<<TorF[c>=b];
    std::cout<<"\nc <= b is "<<TorF[c<=b];    
    return 0;
}
```

```c
a < b is False
a > b is True
a != b is True
c >= b is True
c <= b is True
```

# 3. Logic Operators

```c
/*Goal: understand the logical operators supported by C++
*/

#include<iostream>
#include<string>

int main()
{
    int A = 5;
    int B = 4;
    int C = 5;
    int D = 0;
    
    std::string TorF[] = {"False", "True"};
    
    //The && operator
    std::cout<<"A == C is "<<TorF[A==C];
    std::cout<<"\n(B == D) is "<<TorF[B==D]; 
    std::cout<<"\n(B > D) is "<<TorF[B>D]; 
    //A true && false = false
    std::cout<<"\n\n(A ==C) && (B == D) is "<<TorF[(A ==C) && (B == D)];  
    //A true and true = true
    std::cout<<"\n(A ==C) && (B > D) is "<<TorF[(A ==C) && (B > D)];     

    //The || operator
    //A true || false = true
    std::cout<<"\n\n(A ==C) || (B == D) is "<<TorF[(A ==C) || (B == D)];  
    //A true || true = true
    std::cout<<"\n(A ==C) || (B > D) is "<<TorF[(A ==C) || (B > D)];  
    
    //The 'Not' operator
    std::cout<<"\n\nA < B is "<<TorF[A<B];
    std::cout<<"\n!(A < B) is "<<TorF[!(A<B)];
    
    std::cout<<"\n\nA == C is "<<TorF[A==C];
    std::cout<<"\n!(A == C) is "<<TorF[!(A==C)];    
    
    return 0;
}
```

```
A == C is True
(B == D) is False
(B > D) is True

(A ==C) && (B == D) is False
(A ==C) && (B > D) is True

(A ==C) || (B == D) is True
(A ==C) || (B > D) is True

A < B is False
!(A < B) is True

A == C is True
!(A == C) is False
```
