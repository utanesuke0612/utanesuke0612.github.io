# 11(0501/)
Hello everybody, welcome back to Daily Dictation 11, 

and I want to say a special thank you to YouTube listener Catch Kathy, who's done all the dictation ,

and she put her answers up there, so we can see her answers and her little mistakes, but that's really good.

She's showing lots of courage and she's also showing very good English skills.
> 她展现了很多勇气，同时也展现出非常好的英语技能。

So thumbs up to you.
> 所以给你点赞。

Thank you very much.

Now we had Daily Dictation 10 yesterday.

Let's listen one more time.

It's a lofty, probably impossible goal.
> 这是一个高远、可能不可能实现的目标。

Much easier than the previous one, yes?

Short and simple.

The answers are right here.

It is a lofty, probably impossible goal.

My goal?

I hope not.

It's a lofty.

Now, it is.

If we say it fast, it's...

The faster we say it, this S sound cancels the T.

It's a lofty.

Lofty got moyo?

Really, really high.

It's a really high goal.

It's almost a dream.

And dreams are almost impossible.

It's not a wish.

Wish is like really almost a...

I wish I could fly.

Wish I could fly.

I can't fly.

Okay?

I dream one day I could fly.

Maybe there will be some machine.

I don't know.

But I hope is something that's possible.

But a lofty hope?

Ah, that's a really, really, really high hope.

A lofty hope.

So, it's a lofty goal.

It's a lofty goal.

**It's a really super high goal.**

Probably impossible.

Oh no!

An impossible goal.

**Nothing is impossible.**

**Everything is possible.**

We hope.

It's a lofty.

Probably impossible goal.

Now, I want you to pay attention to the **intonation**.
> intonation [ˌɪntəˈneɪʃ(ə)n] n. 声调，语调；

The guy who says it says, It's a lofty.

Probably impossible goal.

So, usually this sentence would be just simply, It's a lofty goal.
> simply [ˈsɪmpli] adv. 仅仅，只，不过；简直
意思是这句话基本可以简化为后面：It's a lofty goal

Oh.

Probably impossible.

The nuance is like it's in **parentheses**.
>  [pəˈrenθəsiːz] n. 圆括号；插入成分

And you can hear that It's a lofty, probably impossible goal.

It's a lofty, probably impossible goal.

It's a lofty, probably impossible goal.

So, what about you guys?

Tell me again about your goals.

Do you have any lofty goals?

I told you mine.

Now, you have to tell me yours.
> 这是一个高远，可能是不可能实现的目标。

Now, you have to tell me yours.

Also, we have daily dictation number 11.

It's a lofty, probably impossible goal.

It's a lofty, probably impossible goal.

Now, we're **approaching** October of 2011. 
> 现在，我们正在接近2011年的十月。

Today is September 22nd.

Korea time, about September 23rd.

And, well, October in America is baseball time.

This is where the World Series Baseball Championships take place.
> 这就是世界棒球大联赛冠军赛举办的地方。
这是一个复合句。主句是“This is where the World Series Baseball Championships take place”，其中包含一个定语从句“where the World Series Baseball Championships take place”。主句的主语是“This”，谓语是“is”，宾语是整个从句。“where”引导定语从句，在从句中充当地点状语。

So, today I've got a little bit of baseball news.

And I'm not just going to do baseball news.

In the future, I'll have soccer news and whatever, any kind of sport.

I'm trying to have many subjects.

So, if you have a subject you want to practice dictation on, please let me know.

So, today we've got a baseball story.

Very simple, well, if you know baseball, simple sentence.

Let's check it out.
> 让我们来看看吧。

Good luck, everybody.

New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays by identical 4-2 scores ,in a day-night doubleheader Wednesday.
> 周三，纽约队在一场日夜双打比赛中以相同的4-2比分横扫了坦帕湾光芒队。

Thank you.

## 🔊 3. 【发音要点】

| 发音现象 | 内容 | 示例 |
|-----------|------|------|
| 🔸 连读现象 | “It's a lofty” 快速说时变成 “itsa lofty” | It'sa lofty goal. |
| 🔸 吞音/弱读 | “probably” 中的中间音节弱化 | prə-bly impossible goal |
| 🔸 强调语调（intonation） | “probably impossible”语调下沉，像在括号中 | It's a lofty, *probably impossible* goal. |
| 🔸 对比语调 | 通常句子：“It’s a lofty goal.” 和强调句：“It’s a lofty, probably impossible goal.” 的语调对比 | 听感上更加感性、生动。 |

##  🗣️ 复述
---

### ✅ 语法是否正确：
- 你的句子大致上是语法正确的，但有几个小地方可以更清晰或地道一些：
  - “**These two groups, these two teams have a match**” 建议改为过去时：“**had a match**”以符合上下文。
  - “**just in a day like Doubleheader Wednesday**” 这个部分语法上有些混乱，建议调整。

---

### 💬 句子是否自然：
- 整体意思表达得不错，但部分表达不够自然：
  - “**There are two teams, New York and Tampa Bay Rays.**” → 更自然的说法是：  
    → “The two teams, New York and the Tampa Bay Rays, played against each other.”
  - “**just in a day like Doubleheader Wednesday**” 这句比较生硬，自然表达可以是：  
    → “in a day-night doubleheader on Wednesday.”

---

### 🔍 表达是否清晰流畅：
- 听得出你理解了原句的意思，也表达了关键要点（队伍、比分、比赛类型），这非常棒！  
- 不过语句之间衔接略显重复或跳跃，例如“these two groups, these two teams”，听起来像在重复；可精简为一次表达。

---

### 🌟 改写建议（更自然流畅的表达）：
> “The New York team swept the Tampa Bay Rays with identical 4-2 scores in a day-night doubleheader on Wednesday.”

或者稍微口语一点：
> “New York beat the Tampa Bay Rays twice on Wednesday, both games ending in the same 4-2 score in a day-night doubleheader.”

# 12(0501/)
Hello everybody, welcome back to Daily Dictation.

How did you do?

Last week's dictation was about baseball.

Let's listen one more time.

New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays by identical 4-2 scores in a day-night doubleheader Wednesday.
> 周三，纽约队在一场日夜双打比赛中以相同的4-2比分横扫了坦帕湾光芒队。

A little bit long, but if you're a baseball fan, maybe you did okay.

New York, New York baseball, New York Mets, or New York Yankees.

Excuse me.

We have two teams, New York Yankees, New York Mets.

Here, we're talking about the New York Yankees.

New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays.

New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays.

New York swept the, swept the, T-T-H, we connect, only keep the T-H sound.

Sweep-t-the, no, swept the.

New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays.

Tampa Bay is a city in Florida, and they have a baseball team called the Rays.

The Sting Rays.

Tampa Bay Rays.

New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays.

By.

So, sweep, this verb is sweep, like with a broom.
> broom [bruːm]  n. 扫帚；

Okay, I'll put a picture.

So, sweep, past tense, is swept.

Swept in baseball and sports.

By.

And then, some numbers usually appear.

Swept by.

Okay, so, New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays by identical 4-2 scores.

By identical 4-2 scores.

Identical.
> identical [aɪˈdentɪk(ə)l] adj. 完全相同的；同一的；（双胞胎）同卵的；

Now, identical means the same thing.

If we say it fast, identical.

Identical.

This N sound can kill the T.

Identical.

Identical.

However, if you listen to the reporter from AP, he does say identical.

Identical scores.

Identical 4-2 scores.

Scores?

How many games were there in a day-night doubleheader Wednesday?

Ah, a doubleheader.

A doubleheader means two games in one day.

A baseball game has nine innings.
> innings [ˈɪnɪŋz] n. 局，回合

That's one game.

A doubleheader means two games in one day.

Okay, so, sweep.

When we use the word, the verb, sweep, it means completely took everything.

Took everything.

So, usually we say, **sweep the series**.
> 横扫了系列赛

And, past tense, swept the series.

So, let's say New York baseball, the Yankees, were going to play Tampa Bay five games.

They're going to play five games.

And, New York won every game.

**We can just say**, New York swept the series.
> 我们可以说，纽约横扫了系列赛。

New York swept the five-game series.

And, that means New York won every game.

They won each game.

Here, it was a doubleheader.

So, two games.

So, New York **swept** the doubleheader.
> 所以，纽约赢得了双重赛。

New York swept the doubleheader Wednesday.

That's the idea.

Now, a doubleheader, was it like a morning game and a night game, an afternoon game and a night game?

How did they do that?

A day-night game.

Which means they had a game in the afternoon.

Then, they had a dinner break.

Then, they had a game after that.

A day-night game.

So, one game in the afternoon.

One game in the evening.

So, if you like baseball, doubleheaders are great.

And, both games, New York swept.

They won both games.

Both games had the same score.

4-2.

4-2.

2.

If we say it fast.

4-2.

Or, we can just get rid of the to.
> 或者，我们可以直接去掉这个to。

4-2.

New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays by identical 4-2 scores in a day-night doubleheader Wednesday.

Exciting baseball news.

So, that's it with baseball.

Let's listen two more times and you **say it along with** the AP Reporter.

Okay? 

**New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays by identical 4-2 scores in a day-night doubleheader Wednesday.**
> 周三，纽约队在一场日夜双打中以相同的4-2比分横扫了坦帕湾光芒队。

So, how did you do?

I hope your listening was okay.

I hope your speaking was okay.

Let's move on to Daily Dictation #12.

Okay.

Daily Dictation #12 is about the picture you just saw.

Back on Saturday, which was September 24th, 2011, on the Google homepage, they had these five cool puppets, these characters, these Muppets.
> Muppets n．木偶剧角色：一群由吉姆·亨森创造的木偶角色，广泛出现在电视节目、电影和其他媒体中，如《芝麻街》和《木偶秀》。

They're called Muppets because it was the birthday of the man who invented these puppets, these dolls, these Muppets.
> puppets n. 木偶；傀儡（puppet 的复数）

The most famous Muppet is Kermit.

Kermit the Frog.

Then there was Miss Piggy.

You're going to hear Kermit singing a very famous song.

It's actually a song by the Carpenters.

But Kermit the Frog did a **remake**.
> remake  [ˌriːˈmeɪk] 
n. （电影或歌曲的）新版，改编版；重做；重制物
vt. 重新制作，改编（电影或歌曲等）；重做

It's called The Rainbow Connection.

And then, when the AP reporter starts speaking, you need to start dictating.

So listen to the song.

The song will play the first time, but then the second, third, and fourth time, there will be no song.

So listen carefully and do your best for the dictation.

And I'll see you again tomorrow.

Bye-bye.

1936.

Someday we'll find it, the Rainbow Connection, the lovers, the dreamers, and me.

Jim Henson, creator of the Muppets, from Kermit the Frog to Sesame Street, is born in Greenville, Mississippi.
> 吉姆·汉森，从蛙王科米特到芝麻街的木偶创作者，出生在密西西比州的格林维尔。

1936

Someday we'll find it

The rainbow connection, The lovers, the dreamers, and me

Hello everybody, welcome back to Dictation number 13

It was about Kermit the Frog, yesterday's dictation

Dictation number 12

I'll give you one more chance, listen to yesterday's dictation

and I'll give you the answers

**Jim Henson, creator of the Muppets From Kermit the Frog to Sesame Street, is born in Greenville, Mississippi**
> Muppet:n. 提线木偶

Okay, so happy birthday to Jim Henson

Well, a couple days ago now

1936, he passed away, he died

but he's a great guy, left a lot of wonderful memories for lots of people
> 但他是一个很棒的人，留下了许多美好的回忆
= He's a great guy who left many wonderful memories.

Kermit the Frog, too cool

Sesame Street, I think everybody knows

Sesame Street, maybe, maybe not

Okay, well here are the answers

Jim Henson

Jim Henson

Now Jim, the full name is actually James

James, but we take the name James and we reduce it to Jim

And we can also say Jimmy

And we can also say Jimmy

But Jimmy is kind of to a child

or maybe really, really close

So typically, we just say Jim

Jim Henson

Now the actual sentence is

Jim Henson is born in Greenville, Mississippi

Jim Henson is born, he was born, his mom gave birth on this day, well a couple days ago in 1936

I am Jim

Sorry

Where was he born?

In Greenville, Mississippi

Mississippi is a state in Southern Central America

**It's right next to the Mississippi River**
> 它就在密西西比河旁边
= It's right beside the Mississippi River.

Mississippi

50 states in America, it's one of the state's.

The **abbreviation** is MS.
> abbreviation  [əˌbriːviˈeɪʃn] n. 缩略词，缩写形式；缩略，缩写

MS is Mississippi. The spelling is fun.

M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I

M-I, crooked letter, crooked letter I, crooked letter, crooked letter I, humpback, humpback I.

Never mind, you don't need to know that. Greenville, Mississippi. It sounds like a small town, I'm not sure.

Who was Jim Henson? Jim Henson was the creator of the Muppets.

The creator of the Muppets. Kermit the Frog, the Snuffle-lumpagus,

uh, who's the pig? Little Miss Piggy, Burton, Ernie, all the guys, everybody Muppets,

the Muppet Show, the Sesame Street characters, they're all Muppets. The creator of the Muppets.

The Muppets. So the Muppets, we need to capitalize this. The Muppets, it's a name.

Creator, creator. We don't say creator in America. We say creator. Creator. Creator of the, creator of the.

And the faster we say this, we can get rid of this. Creator of the, creator of the. I'm not saying any F sound.

Creator of the Muppets. Creator of the Muppets. From Kermit the Frog to Sesame Street. Creator of the Muppets. These monster puppets. Muppets. Monster puppets.

And we had every kind of Muppets. We had Kermit the Frog. He wasn't a monster.

And we had Sesame Street with the Cookie Monster. Count Dracula. Big Bird. All the cool characters. I liked Big Bird. I liked Big Bird and the Cookie Monster.

And Oscar the Grouch. The garbage can. Muppet. Do you know? Who was your favorite Muppet?

So he created all of these guys. Everybody. From A to Z. From Alpha to Omega. From Kermit the Frog to Sesame Street. He did everything. Bert and Ernie.

Jim Henson. Creator of the Muppets. From Kermit the Frog to Sesame Street. He was born in Greenville, Mississippi.

Jim Henson is born in Greenville, Mississippi on this day back in 1936. Who was Jim Henson? He was the creator of the Muppets. The Muppets? Oh, that's everyone from Kermit the Frog to Sesame Street.

Jim Henson. Creator of the Muppets. From Kermit the Frog to Sesame Street. Is born in Greenville, Mississippi.

Not too bad. I hope. I'll bet you did a good job. Let's listen two more times. You say it along with the announcer. And then we got more news.
> 还不错。我希望如此。我敢打赌你做得很好。让我们再听两遍。你跟着播音员一起说。然后我们有更多新闻。

Jim Henson. Creator of the Muppets. From Kermit the Frog to Sesame Street. Is born in Greenville, Mississippi.

Jim Henson. Creator of the Muppets. From Kermit the Frog to Sesame Street. Is born in Greenville, Mississippi.

So, how did you do? Okay. Today's dictation. Dictation number 13 is about...

Mosquitoes. I hate mosquitoes. 
> mosquitoes [məsˈki:təʊz] n. 蚊子（mosquito 的复数）

And we've got some bad mosquitoes that have gone to America. They're from Asia **originally**. Southeast Asia. And somehow they got to America. And when they bite you, I guess it's **stings**.
> originally [əˈrɪdʒənəli]  美 [əˈrɪdʒənəli] adv. 起初，原来；独创地，新颖地
蚊子。我讨厌蚊子。我们有一些坏蚊子去了美国。它们最初来自亚洲。东南亚。它们不知怎么就到了美国。它们咬你的时候，我想应该是蛰得很疼。
> sting：动词/名词，指“刺痛、蛰痛” 例句：The bee sting really hurt.（蜜蜂蛰得真的很疼。）


So, I don't know. But **they're kind of scary looking** mosquitoes. Not too difficult. A little bit long, but not too bad. Do the dictation. I'll give you the answers tomorrow. See ya.

See ya.

Asian tiger mosquitoes **are native to** the tropics of Southeast Asia. But in the past few years, **they've spread all across** the Southeastern United States.

Welcome to Daily Dictation 14, but first we got to go back to Daily Dictation 13.

> məˈskiːtəʊ / 这是关于蚊子的。你的听写怎么样？再听一遍。
> listen up:听着

Asian tiger mosquitoes **are native to** the tropics of Southeast Asia, but in the past few years, **they've spread all across** the southeastern United States.

Yes, scary mosquito news. How did you do? Let's **check out** the answers.

Asian tiger mosquitoes, Asian tiger mosquitoes.

Now, Asian tiger mosquitoes, mosquitoes. Mosquitoes? No. Mosquitoes.

I'm from Wisconsin in the United States and mosquitos, we have a cute name for mosquitos.　

Skeeters. Skeeters.
> Skeeters 蚊子

And it comes from the pronunciation.

We don't say mosquitos, we say mosquitos. Mosquitos. Skeeters.

So we have that kind of name. So if you know another American from Wisconsin, you can ask him or her about skeeters.
> 

Do you have skeeters in Wisconsin? You can ask him or her about that.


Anyway, Asian tiger mosquitoes. Wow, tiger mosquitoes.

Are native to the tropics of Southeast Asia. So native to.

native to.

native to. Shane is native to the United States. Shane is native to Wisconsin in the United States.

> Cats reputedly have nine lives, and he clearly wanted to spend at least one of them here in New York City.


Cats are known to the people because most of the people think cats have nine lives and he clearly want to spend at least one of them here in New York City. Why? Because New York City is very crowded and the cats tend to do not so dangerous actions. So, maybe the cats want to spend one of their lives in New York City.

### 💬 **句子自然性**

原句使用了重复和有些生硬的表达（如 “known to the people”, “do not so dangerous actions”）。如果目的是自然的复述，可以这样表达：

#### 🟢 推荐复述版本（自然简洁）：

> "People say cats have nine lives, and he clearly wanted to spend one of them here in New York City, maybe because it's crowded and not too dangerous for a cat."

或者更有口语感的版本：

> "Cats are said to have nine lives, and this one clearly wanted to use one in New York City — probably because it’s crowded and not too risky for a cat."

---

### 🔊 **表达清晰流畅**

* 思路基本清晰，但有点啰嗦、重复，比如 “because most of the people think…” 可以更精炼。
* 后半部分说明猫为什么选择纽约时有些模糊，建议更具体一些。

---

### ✨ 总结建议：

你已经掌握了原意的核心概念，下一步可以尝试：

* 使用更简洁自然的表达方式；
* 注意时态和主谓一致；
* 避免中文式表达（如“do not so dangerous actions”）。

# 16(0505/)

Hey everybody, it's Daily Dictation 16, DD16, but let's go back to Daily Dictation number 15.

Listen one more time.

Did you get the answers?

The frantic pacing, scene changes every 11 seconds on average, often leaves kids zoned out and spun up, unable to concentrate.

Okay, it was a little, it was very difficult, but let me help you.

Now, this article is negative.

It is not pro-SpongeBob.

It's a little bit negative, SpongeBob.

Why?

Because of the frantic pacing.

The frantic pacing.
> 疯狂的节奏

That's the key.

Pacing basically means speed.

Speed.

So let's just change it.

Pacing means speed.

The frantic pacing. The frantic speed.

What does frantic mean? 

Frantic means loss of control.
> 恐慌意味着失去控制

There's no control.It's extremely high tempo.

It's very, very fast.Uncontrollable fast. Losing control.

So, for example, **I had a frantic day.**
> 举个例子，我度过了一个疯狂的一天。

**I was doing this, and then I was doing this, and then I was doing this, and I was busy.**

I was looking here and there, and I was doing so many things.

I was doing so many things.

Frantic.

It's crazy.

So busy, so fast, it's crazy.

It's crazy.

Frantic.

Nowadays, the stock market is very frantic.
> 

Yeah, it's frantic.

Frantic news.

Lots of news is frantic.
> 如今，股市非常疯狂。
= Currently, the stock market is highly unpredictable.

Things are happening very fast.
 
The television show, SpongeBob, has frantic pacing.

Let's talk about other children's shows.

For example, Sesame Street.

Sesame Street is pretty relaxed.

It's nice.

It's slow-paced.

Do you know the show Teletubbies?

Wow!

Teletubbies is very slow.

The **opposite** of frantic.
> 与狂乱相反。opposite [ˈɒpəzɪt] adj. 完全相反的，截然不同的；

If you watch SpongeBob, there's lots of activity.

Things are moving, and things are changing, and we see SpongeBob, then we see something else,
 
then we see something else.

Every time the picture changes, or the camera changes, we call that a scene change.  

A scene change.

So the frantic pacing.

The very, very rapid speed.

The high speed.

So the sentence actually is, "The frantic pacing often leaves kids zoned out and spun up."

We could change the sentence, "The frantic pacing often leaves kids unable to concentrate."
> 我们可以修改句子，"疯狂的步调经常让孩子们无法集中注意力。

That's the key.

The frantic pacing often leaves kids unable to concentrate.

But let's talk about this section.

Scene changes every 11 seconds on average.

This describes this.

What kind of frantic pacing?

How is the pacing so frantic?

Why is the speed considered so fast?

Because scene changes.

Scene ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, changes every 11 seconds on average.

Sometimes 5 seconds, sometimes 15 seconds.

But on average, every 11 seconds, the scene changes very quick.

Sesame Street, very slow. 

Teletubbies, really slow.

So the SpongeBob, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

The scene changes every 11 seconds on average.

Now, let's talk about pronunciation.

Frantic pacing, F-P.

F-P.

Frantic pacing.

Scene changes every.

Whenever we have no consonant, no consonant, we need to connect.

11, no consonant.

On, no consonant.

Average, no consonant.

So that means if we say it quickly, we need to connect sounds, connect sounds, connect sounds,

connect sounds.

Changes every, changes every 11, changes every 11, changes every 11 seconds.

Seconds on, seconds on. 

In America, we say on.

When you see O-N, most Americans pronounce it on.

Seconds on, on average, on average.

Changes every 11 seconds on average.

Changes every 11 seconds on average.

Frantic pacing.

Why frantic pacing?

Scene changes every 11 seconds on average.

Frantic pacing.

Why frantic pacing?

Scene changes every 11 seconds on average.

So this frantic pacing is bad.

Why is it bad?

Because it often, it usually, it many times, it tends to leave kids.

In this case, often leaves kids.

We have a **singular** subject.
> singular [ˈsɪŋɡjələ(r)] adj. 单数的，单数形式的；<正式>非凡的，突出的；

So our verb has an S. It often leaves kids.

It often leaves, **to leave someone in some state.**
> 它经常会让人陷入某种状态。
= It often leaves someone in a certain state.
= It commonly leaves someone in a specific situation.

The meal, the spaghetti meal, **left me full.**
 
Running the marathon race **left me tired.**

The beers **left me drunk.**

The sad movie **left me in tears.**

**The frantic pacing leaves kids zoned out and spun up.**
> 疯狂的步调让孩子们感到恍惚和兴奋。

Now, we have two phrasal verbs.

Two two-word verbs.

An action verb and a preposition.
> preposition [ˌprepəˈzɪʃ(ə)n] n. 介词，前置词

An action verb and a preposition.

What do these mean?

Zoned out.Zoned out.

We have to connect the sound.

**Zoned out means spaced out.**
> "Zoned out"意味着心不在焉。

It means you've lost all concentration.
> 这意味着你已经失去了所有的注意力。

This is the idea of zoned out.
> 这就是"走神"的概念。
> = This is what zoning out means.

I'll start, okay, and then I'll become zoned out.
> 我会开始，好的，然后我会走神。

Watch.

Sorry.

**I was zoned out.**

My mind is gone.
> 我的思绪飘忽不定。

Sometimes when people watch TV, you look at them, oh my god, that person is gone.

He is zoned out.

So when kids watch Spongebob, they become zoned out.

Or, and/or, they become spun up.
> 或者，他们变得兴奋起来。

Spun up.

Now, when we have a two-word verb, a phrasal verb with up, the preposition is,

up, the preposition up, it emphasizes the up, emphasizes the verb.

For example, **eat up.Clean up.Shut up**.

In this case, spun up.

So, eat up.

Eat up means eat everything.
> 吃光表示吃掉所有东西。

Everything on your plate, eat it up.
> [pleɪt]

Eat everything.

Clean up means clean perfectly.Completely clean.
> 清理干净意味着完美清洁。

Shut up means, **shut up completely**.

Don't say anything.

And here, we have **spun up**.
> spun [spʌn]  美 [spʌn] 
v. （使）旋转；（使）急转身；纺线；结网；驾车飞驰（spin 的过去式及过去分词）

Present tense would be **spin up**.

What does spin up?

A similar word, spun up, similar in meaning would be **wound up.**

Wound.
> wound [wuːnd] 

W-o-u-n-d.

Wound?

No.

Wound up.
> 绷紧了。

And the present tense would be wind.

Wind up.

So, I got a watch.

Now, usually, this watch actually uses a battery.

But, a long time ago, if you want your watch to operate, you need to wind up the watch.
> 但是，很久以前，如果你想让你的手表运转，你需要给手表上发条。
= In the past, watches had to be wound up to function.

Right?

You have to twist it.
> 你必须扭转它。twist [twɪst] 

You have to wind it up.

Wind up.

Wind means to spin.

You spin it up.
> 你把它旋转起来。

You spin it up.

So, sometimes, kids are watching SpongeBob and they're like... 

But, inside, their insides are getting wound up like a watch.
> 但是，在内部，他们的内心像手表一样被绷紧了。

if you get to wound up, if you keep winding up, what happens, you spin out of control
> 如果你变得过度兴奋，如果你继续激动不已会发生什么，你会失去控制
get wound up 变得紧张或激动 
spin out of control 变得失控

you become crazy so if somebody is very hyper **hyperactive** 
> hyperactive[ˌhaɪpərˈæktɪv] adj. 极度活跃的；活动过度的

we can say that person is spun up, that person is wound up,

so when kids watch spongebob, they become spaced out, they become zoned out
> 当孩子们看海绵宝宝时，他们变得恍惚,他们变得恍惚

and then they become wound up or spun up,

and because of this they become unable to concentrate,

and the pronunciation unable to, unable to ,it sounds like a duh unable to concentrate unable to concentrate

okay so the original sentence ,let's let's go to the simple sentence : **the frantic pacing often leaves kids unable to concentrate**

what kind of frantic pacing scene changes, every 11 seconds on average,

why unable to concentrate, because the frantic pacing often leaves kids zoned out and spun up , do you understand?

good, say it with me slowly,

the frantic pacing scene changes every 11 seconds on average often leave kids zoned out and spun up unable to concentrate

in america almost always there's no t, often often often, let's say it faster faster this time

**The frantic pacing -- scene changes every 11 seconds on average --- often leaves kids zoned out and spun up, unable to concentrate.**

so it was difficult, yes i know , listen to the reporter and try and say it with the reporter, good luck

**the frantic pacing scene changes every 11 seconds on average, often leaves kids zoned out and spun up, unable to concentrate .**

okay now it's time for daily dictation 16 ,sad story ,the philippines the island nation in the pacific ocean, 

they have had a very difficult time recently, two typhoons, now in the atlantic ocean we have hurricanes, so hurricanes hit america ,

but in the pacific ocean we use the word typhoons as far as i know ,it's the same thing,

but these typhoons they've had, two typhoons in about a week , **it's really terrible.**

the story is about the philippines, so listen carefully and good luck and i'll see you next time.

battered soaked and flooded the philippines is being hit by its second typhoon in a week.

battered [ˈbætəd]  美 [ˈbætərd]

# 17(0505/)

Hey everybody, DD17, Daily Dictation 17.

Before we go there, let's listen to yesterday's news one more time.

Battered, soaked, and flooded, the Philippines is being hit by its second typhoon in a week.
> 菲律宾遭受猛烈风暴、淹水和洪水袭击，一周内遭遇第二次台风袭击。
句子**主语**为 the Philippines
主语后面的**谓语动词**为 is being hit
谓语动词后面的**动词** hit 是被动语态
谓语动词后面的**宾语**为 its second typhoon
宾语后面的**定语从句**为 in a week

> battered [ˈbætəd]  美 [ˈbætərd] 
adj. 破旧的；磨损的；弄垮的；受到虐待的
v. 连续猛击；磨损（batter 的过去分词）

> soaked[səʊkt]  美 [soʊkt] adj. 湿透的，浸透的 v. 浸湿

> flooded [ˈflʌdɪd]  美 [ˈflʌdɪd]v. （使）淹没在洪水中；被水淹没；

Very sad news in the Philippines.

How did you do on the dictation?

Battered, soaked, and flooded.

Those are the key words.

Battered, B-A-T-T-E-R-E-D.

Battered, battered, battered.

Soaked, soaked, and flooded. 

And flooded.

So, we've got three **variations** of the E-D sound.
> variations [ˌverɪˈeʃən] n. 变化，变动；变奏曲；变化

Battered, kind of a quick, short D.

Soaked, it's a T sound.

Soaked, and flooded.

It's a schwa, it's an ıd, ıd.

We have to add the ıd.

Flooded, how do you go?

Flooded.

Battered, soaked, flooded.

Battered, soaked, flooded.

Battered, soaked, and flooded.

So, what does battered mean?

It means to be hit.

It means to be constantly hit.

Always, repeatedly, **continuously** hit.

Battered.

Soaked.

Soaked.

It means to be **drenched** in water.
> 这意味着被水浸透了
> drenched [drentʃt]  
adj. 湿透的；充满的
v. 浸湿；大量覆盖；给（动物）灌药（drench 的过去式和过去分词）

Completely wet.

With water, of course.

Well, rain, actually.

Or the ocean.

Soaked.

No umbrella.

Raining really hard.

You become soaked.

Two typhoons.

You will become soaked.

Battered, soaked, and flooded.

So, a flood is when there's so much rain that a river or a lake overflows and goes into the streets.
> 所以，洪水是指雨水太多，河流或湖泊溢出并流入街道。
> overflow:vi. 溢出；泛滥；充溢 

And into our homes.

And into our fields.
> fields [ˈfiːldz] 
n. 田地，田野；专业，领域；现场，实地

Water goes and gets higher and higher and higher where water shouldn't be.

So, **water goes where there's not supposed to be water.**
> 所以，水流到不应有水的地方。
not supposed to be 不应该有水的地方
**这句话包含以下语法：**
主谓宾结构
定语从句
存在倒装
= Water goes where it's not supposed to be.


And it gets higher and higher and higher.

That is a flood.

Sometimes floods are just little floods.

But sometimes they're huge floods.

I live in Seoul, South Korea.

This summer, we had a very bad flood.

But nothing like the last two typhoons in the Philippines.

They got really bad floods.

And you can see in the picture the flooding.

Battered, soaked, and flooded.

Battered, soaked, and flooded.

The Philippines.

Now, we always keep the the here.

The Philippines.

Because there are many islands.

And all of these islands together make the country.
> 所有这些岛屿共同组成了这个国家。
> = All these islands together form the country.
= 

It's like the United States.

All of the states together make the United States.

Okay?

Okay?

The Philippines is being hit by, is being hit by, is being hit, is being battered by.

It's second typhoon.

Second.

Now, when you write this word second, you have to write the nd.

Or, just write it like this.

Second.

No.

Second.

And this d sound actually connects to the t.

Second ty.

No.

Second ty.

Second typhoon.

Typhoon.

And we have the ph.

It's an f sound.

The Philippines is being hit by its, by its second typhoon in a week.

Second typhoon in a week.

It's a sad news story, but I think the dictation is not too bad.

So, let's say it together, you and me.

Ready?

One.

Slowly.

Two.

Three.

**Battered, soaked, and flooded.The Philippines is being hit by its second typhoon in a week.**

A little bit faster.

**Battered, soaked, and flooded.The Philippines is being hit by its second typhoon in a week.**

Great job.

Let's listen to the original audio, and you say it along with the announcer.
 
**Battered, soaked, and flooded.The Philippines is being hit by its second typhoon in a week.**

Okay.

For Daily Dictation 17, I have a happy story.

It's actually a really cute story.

If you like dogs.

Well, sometimes dogs, they have an owner, but some dogs don't have a home.

They don't have an owner.

We can call them **stray dogs**.
> 我们可以称呼它们为流浪狗。

Well, these dogs usually end up going to an **animal shelter**.
> 如果狗狗在动物收容所，

And if the dogs are at an animal shelter,

they try to give the dogs away,

but usually nobody wants them.

So they put the dogs to sleep.

They kill the dogs.

**Euthanasia**.
> euthanasia[ˌjuːθəˈneɪziə] n. 安乐死

It's kind of sad.

But,

there's a grandmother in America,who saw these dogs, who sees these dogs,

and she says, No!

We're not going to put them to sleep.

I'm going to make them into search and rescue dogs.

So,

there's a tragedy,
> 英 [ˈtrædʒədi] n. 悲惨事件，惨剧；悲剧（作品）；不幸，遗憾；令人非常烦乱（或生气）的情形

like the typhoon in the Philippines or Fukushima,

the nuclear incident,

and the tsunami in Japan,or an earthquake,

like in Japan,or in New Zealand,or in Chile.

She has these dogs,

and they're trained to find people.

It's a beautiful story.

And I've got one sentence,very short.

It's about the dogs.

So you listen carefully,and see if you can get the full sentence.

Good luck, everybody.

A few years ago,they were thought to be useless, past their prime.Not now.
> 他们被认为是无用的,过了他们的黄金时期。

## 🗣️ 复述

谢谢你的复述！以下是你的句子：

**“A few years ago, these dogs were thought to be useless. Most people think these dogs are useless, and past their prime, but not now.”**


### ✅ 语法是否正确：

* 整体语法基本正确，但时态有些混乱。
* 第一部分用了过去时 “were thought”，而第二句却转为一般现在时 “Most people think”，这个转换需要明确是否是现在的普遍看法，还是描述过去的误解。
* “and past their prime” 结构上有些悬浮，建议与“useless”统一为形容词搭配结构。

---

### 💬 句子是否自然：

* 有一点重复，“these dogs were thought to be useless”和“these dogs are useless”重复传达了相似的意思。
* 更自然的表达可以通过合并句子或改写来减少冗余。

---

### 🔄 表达是否清晰流畅：

* 大致清楚，但逻辑连接词和语序可以改进使句子更流畅。

---

### ✏️ 改写建议：

你可以这样表达更自然又清晰的版本：

> **A few years ago, these dogs were thought to be useless and past their prime — but not anymore.**
> （几年前，人们认为这些狗已经没用了，也过了黄金时期——但现在不是这样了。）

或者：

> **People used to think these dogs were useless and past their prime, but that has changed.**


# 18(0505/)

Hey everybody, it's time for Daily Dictation 18, DD 18 and listening comprehension, 
> comprehension 美 [ˌkɑːmprɪˈhenʃ(ə)n] 
n. 理解力，领悟力；（听力或阅读）理解测试；包括，包含

but first we need to **wrap up**, we need to finish Daily Dictation 17.
> 结束

Listen one more time and I'll give you the answers.

A few years ago they were thought to be useless past their prime, not now.
> 几年前，他们被认为是过了巅峰期而毫无用处，但现在不是这样了。
past their prime 过气的，过时的

So how did you do?

Let's **go over** the answers.
> 让我们来回顾答案。

A few years ago.

A few years ago.

Now be careful with this sound.

You do not want to say a few years, you want to say a few years.

My recommendation, when you have this word, this word always connect the sound.

**Try your best to connect your sound.**

Few years.

Each year.

Last year.

First year.

Fifth year.

Just connect the sounds and it will be easy to hear the word year.

Sometimes, for some students, if you say the words separately, it sounds like ear and not year , year.

It's a tough sound.

So, a few years.

We have few, so we have to have an S. Connect the sound.

A few years ago.

A few years ago.

Several years ago.

Three years ago.

Three years ago.

Four years ago.

Five years ago.

That's what that means.
> 这就是它的意思。

They. In this case, they **refers to** the stray dogs.The homeless dogs. 
> 它们。在这种情况下，它们指的是流浪狗。无家可归的狗。

A few years ago, they were thought to be. Thought to be, we can change that. They were, I'll use a different color, considered.


They were considered, they were thought to be useless. Word thought. T-H-O-U-G-H-T. It's an A-W sound. Thought. No, not for American pronunciation. Thought. Kind of drop the chin. Thought.

T-T. Connected. Keep the second sound. Thought-to. No. Thought to. A few years ago, 

**they were thought to be useless. Oh, what a terrible word. Useless.**

These dogs are useless. Get rid of them. Kill them. We don't want them. That's really sad. 
> 这些狗是无用的。摆脱它们。杀死它们。我们不想要它们。这真的很悲哀。

**Especially** if you like dogs. And we see this straight. Now, sometimes stray dogs are mean.
> 特别是如果你喜欢狗。我们看到这一点。现在，有时流浪狗是凶狠的。
> see this straight 直截了当地
> mean 凶恶的

They're loud. They cause problems. Yes. But not every stray dog. 

And the story is about the grandmother. And the grandmother, several years ago, she sees these dogs.

And everybody thought, these dogs, they're useless. We have to get rid of them.

Past their prime. Past their prime. Past their prime. Past their. So here we have a T and a TH. We can connect it. Past their. Past their.

But then this S sound is really strong, so pass there, pass there.

It almost sounds like ser, pass there, pass there.

There's a little bit of th, pass there, pass there.

But the faster we say it, pass there, pass there, pass there prime, pass there prime.

There's no th, there's no th, there's no t, there's no th.

You can get rid of it because of the S.

What does pass there prime mean?

Well, look at me.

How old do you think I am?

Yes, that's right.

I'm 27 years old.

No, actually I'm not.

I'm 43 years old.

**But I still feel strong.**

**I feel powerful.**

**I feel creative.**

**I feel active.**

**I feel productive.**

**I'm still in my prime.**
> 我仍然处于巅峰状态。
> = I'm still at my peak.
> = I'm still in my best years.

A seven-year-old child, a 15-year-old boy or girl, **they're before their prime.**

**Before their prime.**
> 在他们的黄金时期之前。
> = Before reaching the peak of their potential.

But when you're 17, 18, 19, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, maybe even 50, **you are in your prime.**
> 但当你年龄在17、18、19、25、30、35、40、45，甚至50岁时，你正值壮年。

In your prime.

**The best years of your life.**

**The most productive years of your life.**

But sometimes when we feel depressed, when we feel sad, when we feel down, when we feel useless,
> 但是有时候当我们感到沮丧、悲伤、情绪低落、觉得无用时，

we might say,**I'm only 43 years old, but I am past my prime**.

What are you talking about?

43 is young. 43 is young.

**You're still in your prime.**

And then, of course, when we get older and older and older, we're past our prime.
> 当我们感觉越来越老的时候，我们已经过了最佳时期。

No longer useful.

**No longer productive.**

**Nobody wants you anymore.**

**Well, I don't think there's such an age.**

I don't care if you're 60, 70, 80.

**As long as you're positive and you're productive and you're creative, you are not past your prime.**

We're all pretty good to go, right?

But these dogs, people think they're past their prime.

Get rid of them.

We don't want them.It's really sad.

So a few years ago, people thought that.

Not now.Not now. Things have changed.

**Now we see these dogs as in their prime.**
> 现在我们看到这些狗正值鼎盛时期。

And we can train these dogs to become rescue dogs.

So once again, the story is about search and rescue dogs.

It's a great story.

And there's a link in the description.

Click on the link and you can find the full story.

So let's practice here.

Say it together.

**A few years ago, they were thought to be useless.Past their prime.Not now.**

One more time.

**A few years ago, they were thought to be useless. Past their prime.Not now.**

Okay. Daily Dictation 18 and listening comprehension is the same story.

But this time, we're going to listen to the grandmother.

And she has very good advice. And it kind of talks about this.

Past your prime.

Past one's prime.

If you are feeling that you are past your prime, think again.

Listen to her.

Do the dictation.

And I'll give you the answers next class.

See you, everybody.

If you are breathing, it is not too late. Get up and get going.
> 如果你还在呼吸，现在还不算太晚。起床并开始行动。
> = It's never too late as long as you're breathing.
> = As long as you're breathing, it's never too late.

| **语调训练**               | "Not now." 要语调坚定，有强调对比的意味                          |

## 🗣️ 复述

> This is a very positive sentence, and the mother tells us if you are breathing, it's not too late, please get up and get going.


你的复述已经很接近原句，语义表达也清晰。以下是针对三个方面的详细反馈：

---

### ✅ 语法是否正确：

整体语法是**正确的**。没有严重的错误，但可以稍微优化语法结构来使句子更紧凑自然。

---

### 🌿 句子是否自然：

目前的句子是可以理解的，但在表达上稍显“口语直译”。尤其是 “**the mother tells us**” 和 “**please get up and get going**” 这一部分稍微有些啰嗦或生硬。可以优化如下：

#### 自然改写建议：

* **The grandmother says** (如果原视频中是奶奶说的)
* **She tells us that if you're still breathing, it's not too late — just get up and get going.**
* **It's such an encouraging message: if you're breathing, it's not too late — get up and go.**

---

### 🔊 表达是否清晰流畅：

表达是清晰的，但稍微有点冗余。比如你加了 “please” 和 “the mother tells us”，这些虽然有礼貌或说明语境，但并不是复述中必须要保留的部分，反而会稀释原句的力量。

---

### ✅ 推荐复述版本：

> "She says, if you're breathing, it's not too late — get up and get going."

或者：

> "If you're still breathing, it's not too late. So stand up and take action."


# 19(0505/)

Hey everybody, it's Daily Dictation 19, DD19, but first you need to make sure you have the answers for Daily Dictation 18.

Let's listen one more time.

**If you are breathing, it is not too late. Get up and get going.**
> 如果你还在呼吸，现在还不算太晚。起床并开始行动。

Okay, that grandmother has the sweetest voice.

I love her voice and I love her message.

Did you do the dictation?

Did you understand?

Well, here it is.

**If you are breathing, if you are breathing, it is not too late.Get up and get going.**

Ah, I like it.

**So her message is to anybody who is, maybe old or very not happy with life, feeling bad about life, very depressed, very lacking of energy.**

And she says, "Hey, if you are breathing, I'm breathing, then it is not too late.

It's not too late.

**You can do anything you want.**

If you are breathing, it is not too late. Get up and get going."

Sorry.

Sorry.

So, that's what I'm doing.

I'm teaching English, but I want to teach English to students around the world.

But what can I do?

But I'm breathing, so I should get up and get going.

**And for me, I can use YouTube to help students around the world with their English dictation,pronunciation, understanding.**

Her story was after she retired from school.

She was a school teacher and she retired.

Then she started a new life, training **rescue dogs.**

I love this lady.

Now, if you, we can take this F sound and connect it.

Now, we could say it's not too late.

But, why does she say it is and not it's?

To **emphasize**.

**To make her point more clear.**
> 为了让她的观点更加清晰。

It's too late.

No, no, no.

For you out there, English is difficult.

If you have questions, ask me questions.

I'm there for you.
> 我会在这里支持你。

= You can count on me.
= I've got your back.

It's a great story.

Let's say it once.

**If you are breathing, it is not too late. Get up and get going.**

Alright.

I'll play the announcer.

Actually, it's the grandmother.

Listen to the grandmother and say it with her.

And then it's DD-19.

**If you are breathing, it is not too late.Get up and get going.** 

Okay.
 
Daily dictation 19.

We had a story about a grandmother.

And this time, it's a story about a grandfather.

This is a really lucky grandfather.

He was driving at night on a **mountainous** road.
> mountainous[ˈmaʊntənəs] adj. 多山的；巨大的，山一般的；波涛汹涌的

And a car was coming towards him, but the lights were too bright.

He was like, "Uh, uh."

He couldn't see.

And he drove over the mountain.

200 feet, which is like 65 meters.

But he's okay.

He survived.

He's lucky.

It's a long sentence.

Not too difficult.

Good luck.

And I'll see you next class.

A 67-year-old grandpa has been found alive after being stuck for six days at the bottom of a **ravine**.

## 🔁 3. 【复述训练建议】

请继续尝试复述原句：“If you are breathing, it is not too late. Get up and get going.”
你的表达已经不错，可以练习多样化表达，比如：

* So long as you're breathing, it's never too late to start.
* As long as you're alive, you still have a chance. Don’t waste it.


> This is very positive. It tells us if you leave, it's never too late. Please get up and get going. Get off your butt.


### ✅ 1. **语法是否正确**

* 整体语法基本正确，但有一个关键动词用错了：

> ❌ “if you **leave**, it's never too late.”
> ✅ 正确应为 “if you **live**” 或原句 “if you **are breathing**”。

📌 **解释**：
“leave（离开）”和“live（活着）”在发音上接近，但意思完全不同。原意是“只要你还活着（还在呼吸）”，而不是“只要你离开”。

---

### 💬 2. **句子是否自然**

* 大致自然，但“Please get up and get going.”前的“Please”让语气听起来有点像命令，略显突兀。

  * 更自然的方式可能是：
    👉 “So get up and get going.” 或 “Then get up and get going.”

---

### 🎯 3. **表达是否清晰流畅**

* 整体意思表达清晰，段落结构有点跳跃，建议稍微调整连接词，使句子之间更顺畅：

📝 **改写建议**：

> "This is a very positive message. It tells us that as long as you're alive, it's never too late. So get up and get going. Get off your butt!"

### 🌟 总结评分（满分5分）：

Hey everybody, welcome back to Daily Dictation 20 DD20, but first let's check DD19, the story about **the grandfather who survived a car accident**. 
> 在车祸中幸存的祖父

It was a little difficult. Let's listen one more time. 

A 67-year-old grandpa has been found alive after being stuck for six days at the bottom of a ravine. 
> ravine [rəˈviːn] n. 沟壑，山涧；峡谷

Yes, there are some difficult words. Let's look at it. 

A 67-year-old grandpa has been found alive. That's good. After being stuck for six days, oh my god, at the bottom of a ravine. 

Oh no, that's really scary news. 

This word you might not know. 

Let's go to the top. A 67-year-old grandpa. Grandpa. A 67-year-old, 67-year, when we have this seven year, connect the N sound. 7-year-old, 7-year-old, grandpa. Grandfather, the typical shortened version, 

we don't say "grandfather," we say "grandpa."

But, when we say it quickly, or when we say it normally, this N cancels the D and we say "grandpa." Grandpa. 

A 67-year-old grandpa has been, and for American

English, we don't say "being," we say "been," we say "been," has been, has been found alive. Wow. 

So, this grandfather was missing. Where is he? Where is he? We don't know. But, finally, they found him alive. 

Is he dead? He's 67 years old. He might have died. He was driving, maybe there was an accident,

a 7-year-old grandpa. He was missing. He died. 


He was missing for how long? After being stuck for 6 days.

So, after 6 days, he was missing for 6 days. But, we don't say "missing," we say "stuck." He was stuck.

After being stuck. And, what does "stuck" mean? It means to be in a place **where you cannot leave**.
> 被困住后。那么，“困住”是什么意思？它意味着被困在一个无法离开的地方。
> 动词短语“being stuck”作为句子的开头，表示动作发生的状态。
连词“And”连接两个句子。
引号内的部分是引用，用于引述别人的话或文字。
动词短语“to be in a place where you cannot leave”作为解释说明的内容。
= After being stuck, what does 'stuck' mean? It means being in a place where you cannot leave.

So, you're in some place, and you cannot leave. For example, **you could be stuck in a meeting.**

Yes, if you work at a company, and every Monday morning, you have a meeting, you cannot leave the meeting.

You're stuck in a meeting. Or, **you could be stuck in traffic.** You're driving to work, but there are too many cars.

The traffic is jammed. Too much traffic. You are stuck in traffic. Or, maybe you're driving, and there's lots of snow.

And, the snow is really deep, and your car's tires, they just spin. And, **you're not going forward. You're not going back. You are stuck in snow.**
> 雪很深，你的车轮只是打转。你无法前进，也无法后退。你被困在雪中。

So, this grandfather was stuck for 6 days. Where was he stuck? Where? At the bottom. At the bottom of a ravine.

What is a ravine? Well, how much space do I have? I've got lots of space.

Well, here's a mountain. Okay? This is a mountain. There's a road on the mountain. And, then, next to the mountain, there's a cliff.

And, down here, there's a river. Okay? So, this is a river. And, then, the mountain goes up again, like this. Okay? So, this is the mountain.

So, on this side of the mountain, there's a road. There was a road here. And, the grandfather was driving on the road. I'll make a car. So, he's driving.

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na. But, there was an accident. And, phew! **His car fell down the ravine.**
> 他的车掉进了峡谷。

Over 60 meters. Over 200 feet. Shhh! Phew! And, it crashed. And, this ravine is so deep. It's **so sharp down**. Sharp. It's a downward, very sharp angle that nobody can see.
> 超过60米。超过200英尺。嘘！噗！然后，它坠毁了。这个峡谷非常深。非常陡峭。陡。这是一个向下的、非常陡峭的角度，没有人能看到。

So, they're looking. But, they can't see the car. And, he was stuck for six days. But, **somehow**, they found him alive. And, he's okay.
> somehow[ˈsʌmhaʊ]  adv. 以某种方式，用某种方法；由于某种不明原因，不知为什么

The **tragedy**, there was another car next to his car. And, inside that car, there was a grandpa, too. But, he died. So, this guy's really lucky.
> tragedy [ˈtrædʒədi]  美 [ˈtrædʒədi] 
n. 悲惨事件，惨剧；悲剧（作品）；不幸，遗憾；令人非常烦乱（或生气）的情形

Who found him? Not the police. Not **rescue dogs**. But, **his family. His family did not give up. They kept looking, and looking, and looking**.
> 谁找到了他？不是警察。不是搜救犬。而是他的家人。他的家人没有放弃。他们不断地寻找，寻找，寻找。

And, every time, they came to a cliff, to where there was a ravine, they would call out, "Dad! Dad!" And, finally, they heard him. "Yeah, I'm here!" Wow. And, they found him. So, it's a really scary story. But, a happy ending.

What a happy ending. For this man.
> 这真是一个幸福的结局。对于这个人来说。

A 67-year-old grandpa has been found alive. Has been found alive after being stuck. After being stuck for six days. 

Now, for, when we say quickly, it sounds almost like fur. So, we can make F-U-R. It sounds like her. But, fur.

"Stuck for six days." "Stuck for six days." Six days, and connect the sound, "at the bottom." At the bottom. American pronunciation, bottom.

"Bottom of a," connect, connect. "Bottom of a ravine." "Ravine." "Ravine." "Ravine." Okay? Check your dictionary for your definition of that word. Once again, "This is a ravine." "Shh." "Pooh." Scary. At the bottom of a ravine, there's usually a river or a stream.
> 底部，连接，连接。峡谷的底部。峡谷。峡谷。峡谷。好吗？查一下你的字典来了解这个词的定义。再说一遍，这是一个峡谷。嘘。噗。可怕。在峡谷的底部，通常会有一条河流或小溪。

Alright. Let's say it together. A 67-year-old grandpa has been found alive after being stuck for six days at the bottom of a ravine.

I'll say it quickly. A 67-year-old grandpa has been found alive after being stuck for six days at the bottom of a ravine.

Now, let's listen to the reporter. And you guys try and say it along with the reporter. Good luck

A 67-year-old grandpa has been found alive after being stuck for six days at the bottom of a ravine.
> 一名67岁的爷爷在峡谷底部被困六天后被发现活着。

Okay. Our next story is also from the news and this is also about an accident. This accident involves a plane and a ferris wheel.
> 好的。我们的下一个故事也来自新闻，也是关于一起事故。这起事故涉及一架飞机和一个摩天轮。

So, here's a picture of a ferris wheel.

It's nice. That's a ferris wheel and a plane. Now, it's a small plane. It's called an ultralight plane.
> ultralight [ˈʌltrəlaɪt] adj. 超轻型的 n. 超轻型飞机
> 这很好。那是一个摩天轮和一架飞机。现在，这是一架小飞机。它被称为超轻飞机。

Ultralight plane. It's a very small plane. This plane and this ferris wheel had an accident.

But everybody was okay. Thank God.

So, this is a longer story. A little bit longer. Do your best and I'll give you the answers next time.

Good luck.

Good luck.

**Saturday, an ultralight plane crashed into a ferris wheel at a rural festival in Australia. Yet, somehow, no one on the amusement ride nor the plane was hurt.**
> 周六，在澳大利亚一个乡村节日上，一架超轻飞机撞上了一个摩天轮。然而，不知何故，游乐设施上的人和飞机上的人都没有受伤。
