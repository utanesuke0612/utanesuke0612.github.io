Hello everybody, welcome back to Daily Dictation 11, 


and I want to say a special thank you to YouTube listener Catch Kathy, who's done all the dictation ,

and she put her answers up there so we can see her answers and her little mistakes, but that's really good.

She's showing lots of courage and she's also showing very good English skills.
> 她展现了很多勇气，同时也展现出非常好的英语技能。

So thumbs up to you.
> 所以给你点赞。

Thank you very much.

Now we had Daily Dictation 10 yesterday.

Let's listen one more time.

It's a lofty, probably impossible goal.
> 这是一个高远、可能不可能实现的目标。

Much easier than the previous one, yes?

Short and simple.

The answers are right here.

It is a lofty, probably impossible goal.

My goal?

I hope not.

It's a lofty.

Now, it is.

If we say it fast, it's...

The faster we say it, this S sound cancels the T.

It's a lofty.

Lofty got moyo?

Really, really high.

It's a really high goal.

It's almost a dream.

And dreams are almost impossible.

It's not a wish.

Wish is like really almost a...

I wish I could fly.

Wish I could fly.

I can't fly.

Okay?

I dream one day I could fly.

Maybe there will be some machine.

I don't know.

But I hope is something that's possible.

But a lofty hope?

Ah, that's a really, really, really high hope.

A lofty hope.

So, it's a lofty goal.

It's a lofty goal.

It's a really super high goal.

Probably impossible.

Oh no!

An impossible goal.

**Nothing is impossible.**

**Everything is possible.**

We hope.

It's a lofty.

Probably impossible goal.

Now, I want you to pay attention to the **intonation**.
> intonation [ˌɪntəˈneɪʃ(ə)n] n. 声调，语调；

The guy who says it says, It's a lofty.

Probably impossible goal.

So, usually this sentence would be just simply, It's a lofty goal.
> simply [ˈsɪmpli] adv. 仅仅，只，不过；简直
意思是这句话基本可以简化为后面：It's a lofty goal

Oh.

Probably impossible.

The nuance is like it's in **parentheses**.
>  [pəˈrenθəsiːz] n. 圆括号；插入成分

And you can hear that It's a lofty, probably impossible goal.

It's a lofty, probably impossible goal.

It's a lofty, probably impossible goal.

So, what about you guys?

Tell me again about your goals.

Do you have any lofty goals?

I told you mine.

Now, you have to tell me yours.

Now, you have to tell me yours.

Also, we have daily dictation number 11.

It's a lofty, probably impossible goal.

It's a lofty, probably impossible goal.

Now, we're **approaching** October of 2011. 
> 现在，我们正在接近2011年的十月。

Today is September 22nd.

Korea time, about September 23rd.

And, well, October in America is baseball time.

This is where the World Series Baseball Championships take place.
> 这就是世界棒球大联赛冠军赛举办的地方。
这是一个复合句。主句是“This is where the World Series Baseball Championships take place”，其中包含一个定语从句“where the World Series Baseball Championships take place”。主句的主语是“This”，谓语是“is”，宾语是整个从句。“where”引导定语从句，在从句中充当地点状语。

So, today I've got a little bit of baseball news.

And I'm not just going to do baseball news.

In the future, I'll have soccer news and whatever, any kind of sport.

I'm trying to have many subjects.

So, if you have a subject you want to practice dictation on, please let me know.

So, today we've got a baseball story.

Very simple, well, if you know baseball, simple sentence.

Let's check it out.

Good luck, everybody.

New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays by identical 4-2 scores ,in a day-night doubleheader Wednesday.
> 周三，纽约队在一场日夜双打比赛中以相同的4-2比分横扫了坦帕湾光芒队。

Thank you.


# 12
Hello everybody, welcome back to Daily Dictation.

How did you do?

Last week's dictation was about baseball.

Let's listen one more time.

New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays by identical 4-2 scores in a day-night doubleheader Wednesday.
> 周三，纽约队在一场日夜双打比赛中以相同的4-2比分横扫了坦帕湾光芒队。

A little bit long, but if you're a baseball fan, maybe you did okay.

New York, New York baseball, New York Mets, or New York Yankees.

Excuse me.

We have two teams, New York Yankees, New York Mets.

Here, we're talking about the New York Yankees.

New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays.

New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays.

New York swept the, swept the, T-T-H, we connect, only keep the T-H sound.

Sweep-t-the, no, swept the.

New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays.

Tampa Bay is a city in Florida, and they have a baseball team called the Rays.

The Sting Rays.

Tampa Bay Rays.

New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays.

By.

So, sweep, this verb is sweep, like with a broom.
> broom [bruːm]  n. 扫帚；

Okay, I'll put a picture.

So, sweep, past tense, is swept.

Swept in baseball and sports.

By.

And then, some numbers usually appear.

Swept by.

Okay, so, New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays by identical 4-2 scores.

By identical 4-2 scores.

Identical.
> identical [aɪˈdentɪk(ə)l] adj. 完全相同的；同一的；（双胞胎）同卵的；

Now, identical means the same thing.

If we say it fast, identical.

Identical.

This N sound can kill the T.

Identical.

Identical.

However, if you listen to the reporter from AP, he does say identical.

Identical scores.

Identical 4-2 scores.

Scores?

How many games were there in a day-night doubleheader Wednesday?

Ah, a doubleheader.

A doubleheader means two games in one day.

A baseball game has nine innings.
> innings [ˈɪnɪŋz] n. 局，回合

That's one game.

A doubleheader means two games in one day.

Okay, so, sweep.

When we use the word, the verb, sweep, it means completely took everything.

Took everything.

So, usually we say, **sweep the series**.
> 横扫了系列赛

And, past tense, swept the series.

So, let's say New York baseball, the Yankees, were going to play Tampa Bay five games.

They're going to play five games.

And, New York won every game.

**We can just say**, New York swept the series.
> 我们可以说，纽约横扫了系列赛。

New York swept the five-game series.

And, that means New York won every game.

They won each game.

Here, it was a doubleheader.

So, two games.

So, New York swept the doubleheader.

New York swept the doubleheader Wednesday.

That's the idea.

Now, a doubleheader, was it like a morning game and a night game, an afternoon game and a night game?

How did they do that?

A day-night game.

Which means they had a game in the afternoon.

Then, they had a dinner break.

Then, they had a game after that.

A day-night game.

So, one game in the afternoon.

One game in the evening.

So, if you like baseball, doubleheaders are great.

And, both games, New York swept.

They won both games.

Both games had the same score.

4-2.

4-2.

2.

If we say it fast.

4-2.

Or, we can just get rid of the to.
> 或者，我们可以直接去掉这个to。

4-2.

New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays by identical 4-2 scores in a day-night doubleheader Wednesday.

Exciting baseball news.

So, that's it with baseball.

Let's listen two more times and you **say it along with** the AP Reporter.

Okay? 

New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays by identical 4-2 scores in a day-night doubleheader Wednesday.

New York swept the Tampa Bay Rays by identical 4-2 scores in a day-night doubleheader Wednesday.

So, how did you do?

I hope your listening was okay.

I hope your speaking was okay.

Let's move on to Daily Dictation #12.

Okay.

Daily Dictation #12 is about the picture you just saw.

Back on Saturday, which was September 24th, 2011, on the Google homepage, they had these five cool puppets, these characters, these Muppets.
> Muppets n．木偶剧角色：一群由吉姆·亨森创造的木偶角色，广泛出现在电视节目、电影和其他媒体中，如《芝麻街》和《木偶秀》。

They're called Muppets because it was the birthday of the man who invented these puppets, these dolls, these Muppets.
> puppets n. 木偶；傀儡（puppet 的复数）

The most famous Muppet is Kermit.

Kermit the Frog.

Then there was Miss Piggy.

You're going to hear Kermit singing a very famous song.

It's actually a song by the Carpenters.

But Kermit the Frog did a **remake**.
> remake  [ˌriːˈmeɪk] 
n. （电影或歌曲的）新版，改编版；重做；重制物
vt. 重新制作，改编（电影或歌曲等）；重做

It's called The Rainbow Connection.

And then, when the AP reporter starts speaking, you need to start dictating.

So listen to the song.

The song will play the first time, but then the second, third, and fourth time, there will be no song.

So listen carefully and do your best for the dictation.

And I'll see you again tomorrow.

Bye-bye.

1936.

Someday we'll find it, the Rainbow Connection, the lovers, the dreamers, and me.

Jim Henson, creator of the Muppets, from Kermit the Frog to Sesame Street, is born in Greenville, Mississippi.
> 吉姆·汉森，从蛙王科米特到芝麻街的木偶创作者，出生在密西西比州的格林维尔。

# 14

Welcome to Daily Dictation 14, but first we got to go back to Daily Dictation 13.

It's about the mosquitoes. How was your dictation? One more time, listen up.

Asian tiger mosquitoes **are native to** the tropics of Southeast Asia, but in the past few years, **they've spread all across** the southeastern United States.

Yes, scary mosquito news. How did you do? Let's **check out** the answers.

Now, Asian tiger mosquitoes, mosquitoes. Mosquitoes? No. Mosquitoes.

> mosquitoes [məsˈki:təʊz] n. 蚊子（mosquito 的复数）

I'm from Wisconsin in the United States and mosquitos, we have a cute name for mosquitos.

Skeeters. Skeeters.
> Skeeters 蚊子

And it comes from the pronunciation.

We don't say mosquitos, we say mosquitos. Mosquitos. Skeeters.

So we have that kind of name. So if you know another American from Wisconsin, you can ask him or her about skeeters.
> 

Do you have skeeters in Wisconsin? You can ask him or her about that.

Anyway, Asian tiger mosquitoes. Wow, tiger mosquitoes.

Are native to the tropics of Southeast Asia. So native to.

**Where are you native to?** Are you native to Vietnam? Are you native to Korea? Are you native to France?

leave me a message. I am native to somewhere, somewhere, somewhere. So I'm native to the United States, but I live in South Korea.

Now these Asian tiger mosquitoes are native to Southeast Asia, but they've moved to the United States.

Just like I'm native to the United States, but I moved to Asia, South Korea, the tiger mosquitoes have moved to the United States.
> 就像我是美国本土的一样，但我搬到了亚洲的韩国，虎蚊子也搬到了美国。

So we've changed positions. So Asian tiger mosquitoes are native to the native to the native to the, native to the, native to the.

You don't hear to. It sounds more like a d. D. D. Very short d sound. Native to the. Native to the. Native to the. Native to the tropics. The tropics.

Ooh. When we say tropics, we think of palm trees and coconuts and very hot weather, rain forests, oceans. We have this image. The tropics. Kind of a beautiful image.

But in the past few. This S cancels the T. Past few. But in the past few years. But in the past few years.

And these words. And these words put them together. Because many students, if they don't connect the sounds, it sounds like few years.

You don't want to say few years. You want to say few years. Few years. But in the past few years. Say it. But in the past few years.

But in the past few years. But in the past few years. But in the past few years. But in the past few years. They've spread all across. They've spread. The mosquitoes have spread.

Just like spread. To spread out. To expand. To go to more places. They've spread. Right now I'm spreading my arms. I'm spreading my fingers. The mosquitoes have spread. From Southeast Asia. To where? To all across. All over.
> 就像传播一样。扩散。扩张。去更多的地方。它们已经传播开来。现在我正在伸展我的手臂。我正在展开我的手指。蚊子已经传播开来。从东南亚。到哪里？遍布各地。遍布整个地方。

Every part. Of. The Southeastern. United States. So the United States. The Southeastern part. That's going to be Florida. Georgia. Louisiana. Mississippi. Arkansas. These states. Would be. Southeast. United States.

And in this video. If you watch the full video. And I'll put the link. They're now in California. So from the Southeast U.S. They've gone over to the Southwest U.S.

And they're dangerous mosquitoes. They're scary. They have many. They can have many diseases. And they sting. Whoo. So let's say it together. Let's go slow. Ready? One, two, three.

Cats **reputedly** have nine lives, and he clearly wanted to spend at least one of them here in New York City.
> 据说猫有九条命，而它显然想在纽约至少度过其中的一条。 


# 15

Hey everybody, welcome back to Daily Dictation, Daily Dictation number 15.

But first, did you get Daily Dictation number 14 about that cat?

Let's listen one more time.

"Cats reputedly have nine lives and he clearly wanted to spend at least one of them here in New York City."
> 据说猫有九条命，而它显然想在纽约至少度过其中的一条。 

Okay, so there's a cat and it lived in New York City.

That's it. Let's look at the sentence here.

"Cats reputedly have nine lives."

Oh, shh. Now this is a difficult word. It's not a very common word.
> 

"Cats reputedly." Reputedly. Reputedly. Reputedly.

"Cats reputedly have nine lives."

"Cats reputedly have nine lives."

"Cats **supposedly** have nine lives."
> 据说猫有九条命。

"I've heard that cats have nine lives." 

"Somebody told me there's a **rumor** that cats have nine lives."
> 有人告诉我有传言说猫有九条命。

"Is that true?"

In America, that's what we say. We think that cats have nine lives.

"Because they get into crazy, dangerous situations."
> 因为它们经常陷入疯狂、危险的情况。

"They fall and yet they survive."

"They're always alive."

"They run on the street and they run and they survive."

"They're tough."

"Does your country think that too or is that only American?"

"What about in the UK? Do they believe that also?"

"Hmm, I wonder."

"So, anyway, in America we do believe that cats have nine lives."

"Cats reputedly have nine lives."

"And he **clearly** wanted to spend."

"And he **absolutely**, without a doubt, there's no question, he wanted to."
> 他绝对，毫无疑问，毫无疑问，他想要的。 

"Here's the first cancellation."

"The N cancels the T."

"And the person speaking, that's Mayor Bloomberg of New York City."

"That's the Mayor of New York City."

"He says, 'Wanted to spend.'

"Wanted to spend."

"Wanted."

"The T is completely gone. It is cancelled."

"Wanted."

"The D and the T come together and we get a D sound."

"Wanted."

"Wanted."

"Wanted."

"Wanted to spend."

"Wanted to spend at least one of them."

"He wanted to spend at least..."

"The faster we say this, the T can be cancelled."

"The L, in this case, cancels the T."

"At least."

"At least."

"At least."

"One of them."

"One of them."

"The faster we say this,"

"This F bottom, this F sound is gone."

"One of them."

"One of them."

"Wanted to spend at least one of them."

"Another question is, what is them?"

"He refers to the cat in the story."
> 他指的是故事中的那只猫。refers to 指的是
= He talks about the cat in the story.
= He mentions the cat in the story.

"This cat in the story clearly, without a doubt, absolutely wanted to spend."
> 故事中的这只猫明显地、毫无疑问地、绝对地想要度过。

"Now when we say spend, we should spend money."

"Spend time."

"Spend energy."

"Here, we're talking spend lives."

"So this cat absolutely wanted to spend at least one of his lives here in New York City."

"Cats reputedly have nine lives."

"Cats reputedly have nine lives."

"And he clearly wanted to spend at least one of them here in New York City."

"Cats reputedly have nine lives and he clearly wanted to spend at least one of them here in New York City."

"So that's the story."

"So there was this cat, he ran away, they found him in New York, he spent some time in New York.

"He had a chip, a computer chip in his back."

"So when he was born, the owner put a computer chip in his back and the cat ran away."

"And in New York City they scanned like an x-ray, they scanned his back."

"They found the chip, they found the owner and they sent the cat back home."

"So it's a happy story."

"So the cat ran away, the cat lived in New York City for about a year and then the cat went back to his home."

"So I hope the cat is happy, it's a nice story."

"Listen to the story two more times and try and repeat along with the reporter."

"Cats reputedly have nine lives and he clearly wanted to spend at least one of them here in New York City."

"Cats reputedly have nine lives and he clearly wanted to spend at least one of them here in New York City."

"Alright, Daily Dictation #15 deals with SpongeBob."

"Have you heard of SpongeBob?"

"SpongeBob is this cartoon character for children, but many adults like him too."

"SpongeBob SquarePants, I believe that's his full name."

"The question is, is SpongeBob good for children, for little children when they're watching SpongeBob?"

**"Is that good for their development or is it bad for their development?"**
> 这对他们的发展有好处还是对他们的发展有害处？
= Is it beneficial or detrimental to their development?

"Hmm, that is the mission."

"It's one sentence, not too long."

"Do the dictation, I'll give you the answers next class."

"Take care everybody."

"The frantic pacing, scene changes every 11 seconds on average, often leaves kids zoned out and spun up, unable to concentrate."
> 疯狂的节奏，平均每11秒变换一次场景，经常让孩子们失去思绪，兴奋不已，无法集中注意力。
zoned out 分心的 / spun up 激动的 / frantic  [ˈfræntɪk] adj. 紧张忙乱的；（由于恐惧或担心）无法控制感情的，发狂似的

> spun [spʌn] v. （使）旋转；（使）急转身；纺线；结网；驾车飞驰（spin 的过去式及过去分词）


# 16

Hey everybody, it's Daily Dictation 16, DD16, but let's go back to Daily Dictation number 15.

Listen one more time.

Did you get the answers?

The frantic pacing, scene changes every 11 seconds on average, often leaves kids zoned out and spun up, unable to concentrate.

Okay, it was a little, it was very difficult, but let me help you.

Now, this article is negative.

It is not pro-SpongeBob.

It's a little bit negative, SpongeBob.

Why?

Because of the frantic pacing.

The frantic pacing.
> 疯狂的节奏

That's the key.

Pacing basically means speed.

Speed.

So let's just change it.

Pacing means speed.

The frantic pacing. The frantic speed.


What does frantic mean? Frantic means loss of control.

There's no control.It's extremely high tempo.

It's very, very fast.Uncontrollable fast. Losing control.

So, for example, I had a frantic day.
> 举个例子，我度过了一个疯狂的一天。

I was doing this, and then I was doing this, and then I was doing this, and I was busy.

I was looking here and there, and I was doing so many things.

I was doing so many things.

Frantic.

It's crazy.

So busy, so fast, it's crazy.

It's crazy.

Frantic.

Nowadays, the stock market is very frantic.
> 

Yeah, it's frantic.

Frantic news.

Lots of news is frantic.
> 如今，股市非常疯狂。
= Currently, the stock market is highly unpredictable.

Things are happening very fast.

The television show, SpongeBob, has frantic pacing.

Let's talk about other children's shows.

For example, Sesame Street.

Sesame Street is pretty relaxed.

It's nice.

It's slow-paced.

Do you know the show Teletubbies?

Wow!

Teletubbies is very slow.

The opposite of frantic.
> 与狂乱相反。

If you watch SpongeBob, there's lots of activity.

Things are moving, and things are changing, and we see SpongeBob, then we see something else,
 
then we see something else.

Every time the picture changes, or the camera changes, we call that a scene change.  

A scene change.

So the frantic pacing.

The very, very rapid speed.

The high speed.

So the sentence actually is, "The frantic pacing often leaves kids zoned out and spun up."

We could change the sentence, "The frantic pacing often leaves kids unable to concentrate."
> 我们可以修改句子，"疯狂的步调经常让孩子们无法集中注意力。

That's the key.

The frantic pacing often leaves kids unable to concentrate.

But let's talk about this section.

Scene changes every 11 seconds on average.

This describes this.

What kind of frantic pacing?

How is the pacing so frantic?

Why is the speed considered so fast?

Because scene changes.

Scene ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, changes every 11 seconds on average.

Sometimes 5 seconds, sometimes 15 seconds.

But on average, every 11 seconds, the scene changes very quick.

Sesame Street, very slow.

Teletubbies, really slow.

So the SpongeBob, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

The scene changes every 11 seconds on average.

Now, let's talk about pronunciation.

Frantic pacing, F-P.

F-P.

Frantic pacing.

Scene changes every.

Whenever we have no consonant, no consonant, we need to connect.

11, no consonant.

On, no consonant.

Average, no consonant.

So that means if we say it quickly, we need to connect sounds, connect sounds, connect sounds,

connect sounds.

Changes every, changes every 11, changes every 11, changes every 11 seconds.

Seconds on, seconds on.

In America, we say on.

When you see O-N, most Americans pronounce it on.

Seconds on, on average, on average.

Changes every 11 seconds on average.

Changes every 11 seconds on average.

Frantic pacing.

Why frantic pacing?

Scene changes every 11 seconds on average.

Frantic pacing.

Why frantic pacing?

Scene changes every 11 seconds on average.

So this frantic pacing is bad.

Why is it bad?

Because it often, it usually, it many times, it tends to leave kids.

In this case, often leaves kids.

We have a singular subject.

So our verb has an S. It often leaves kids.

It often leaves, **to leave someone in some state.**
> 它经常会让人陷入某种状态。
= It often leaves someone in a certain state.
= It commonly leaves someone in a specific situation.

The meal, the spaghetti meal, **left me full.**

Running the marathon race **left me tired.**

The beers **left me drunk.**

The sad movie **left me in tears.**

**The frantic pacing leaves kids zoned out and spun up.**
> 疯狂的步调让孩子们感到恍惚和兴奋。

Now, we have two phrasal verbs.

Two two-word verbs.

An action verb and a preposition.

An action verb and a preposition.

What do these mean?

Zoned out.Zoned out.

We have to connect the sound.

Zoned out means spaced out.

It means you've lost all concentration.

This is the idea of zoned out.

I'll start, okay, and then I'll become zoned out.
> 我会开始，好的，然后我会走神。

Watch.

Sorry.

I was zoned out.

My mind is gone.
> 我的思绪飘忽不定。

Sometimes when people watch TV, you look at them, oh my god, that person is gone.

He is zoned out.

So when kids watch Spongebob, they become zoned out.

Or, and/or, they become spun up.
> 或者，他们变得兴奋起来。

Spun up.

Now, when we have a two-word verb, a phrasal verb with up, the preposition is,

up, the preposition up, it emphasizes the up, emphasizes the verb.

For example, eat up.Clean up.Shut up.

In this case, spun up.

So, eat up.

Eat up means eat everything.
> 吃光表示吃掉所有东西。

Everything on your plate, eat it up.
> [pleɪt]

Eat everything.

Clean up means clean perfectly.Completely clean.
> 清理干净意味着完美清洁。

Shut up means, shut up completely.

Don't say anything.

And here, we have **spun up**.
> spun [spʌn]  美 [spʌn] 
v. （使）旋转；（使）急转身；纺线；结网；驾车飞驰（spin 的过去式及过去分词）

Present tense would be **spin up**.

What does spin up?

A similar word, spun up, similar in meaning would be **wound up.**

Wound.
> wound [wuːnd] 

W-o-u-n-d.

Wound?

No.

Wound up.

And the present tense would be wind.

Wind up.

So, I got a watch.

Now, usually, this watch actually uses a battery.

But, a long time ago, if you want your watch to operate, you need to wind up the watch.
> 但是，很久以前，如果你想让你的手表运转，你需要给手表上发条。
= In the past, watches had to be wound up to function.

Right?

You have to twist it.
> 你必须扭转它。twist [twɪst] 

You have to wind it up.

Wind up.

Wind means to spin.

You spin it up.
> 你把它旋转起来。

You spin it up.

So, sometimes, kids are watching SpongeBob and they're like... 

But, inside, their insides are getting wound up like a watch.
> 但是，在内部，他们的内心像手表一样被绷紧了。

if you get to wound up, if you keep winding up, what happens, you spin out of control
> 如果你变得过度兴奋，如果你继续激动不已会发生什么，你会失去控制
get wound up 变得紧张或激动 
spin out of control 变得失控

you become crazy so if somebody is very hyper **hyperactive** 
> hyperactive[ˌhaɪpərˈæktɪv] adj. 极度活跃的；活动过度的

we can say that person is spun up, that person is wound up,

so when kids watch spongebob, they become spaced out, they become zoned out
> 当孩子们看海绵宝宝时，他们变得恍惚,他们变得恍惚

and then they become wound up or spun up,

and because of this they become unable to concentrate,

and the pronunciation unable to, unable to ,it sounds like a duh unable to concentrate unable to concentrate

okay so the original sentence ,let's let's go to the simple sentence the frantic pacing often leaves kids unable to concentrate

what kind of frantic pacing scene changes every 11 seconds on average,

why unable to concentrate, because the frantic pacing

often leaves kids zoned out and spun up , do you understand?

good, say it with me slowly, the frantic pacing

scene changes every 11 seconds on average often leave kids zoned out and spun up unable to concentrate

in america almost always there's no t, often often often, let's say it faster faster this time

**The frantic pacing -- scene changes every 11 seconds on average --- often leaves kids zoned out and spun up, unable to concentrate.**

so it was difficult, yes i know , listen to the reporter and try and say it with the reporter good luck

the frantic pacing scene changes every 11 seconds on average often leaves kids zoned out and spun up,unable to concentrate 


okay now it's time for daily dictation 16 ,sad story ,the philippines the island nation

# 17

Hey everybody, DD17, Daily Dictation 17.

Before we go there, let's listen to yesterday's news one more time.

Battered, soaked, and flooded, the Philippines is being hit by its second typhoon in a week.
> 菲律宾遭受猛烈风暴、淹水和洪水袭击，一周内遭遇第二次台风袭击。
句子**主语**为 the Philippines
主语后面的**谓语动词**为 is being hit
谓语动词后面的**动词** hit 是被动语态
谓语动词后面的**宾语**为 its second typhoon
宾语后面的**定语从句**为 in a week

> battered [ˈbætəd]  美 [ˈbætərd] 
adj. 破旧的；磨损的；弄垮的；受到虐待的
v. 连续猛击；磨损（batter 的过去分词）

> flooded [ˈflʌdɪd]  美 [ˈflʌdɪd]v. （使）淹没在洪水中；被水淹没；

Very sad news in the Philippines.

How did you do on the dictation?

Battered, soaked, and flooded.

Those are the key words.

Battered, B-A-T-T-E-R-E-D.

Battered, battered, battered.

Soaked, soaked, and flooded.

And flooded.

So, we've got three variations of the E-D sound.

Battered, kind of a quick, short D.

Soaked, it's a T sound.

Soaked, and flooded.

It's a schwa, it's an ıd, ıd.

We have to add the ıd.

Flooded, how do you go?

Flooded.

Battered, soaked, flooded.

Battered, soaked, flooded.

Battered, soaked, and flooded.

So, what does battered mean?

It means to be hit.

It means to be constantly hit.

Always, repeatedly, continuously hit.

Battered.

Soaked.

Soaked.

It means to be drenched in water.
> 这意味着被水浸透了
> drenched [drentʃt]  
adj. 湿透的；充满的
v. 浸湿；大量覆盖；给（动物）灌药（drench 的过去式和过去分词）

Completely wet.

With water, of course.

Well, rain, actually.

Or the ocean.

Soaked.

No umbrella.

Raining really hard.

You become soaked.

Two typhoons.

You will become soaked.

Battered, soaked, and flooded.

So, a flood is when there's so much rain that a river or a lake overflows and goes into the streets.
> 所以，洪水是指雨水太多，河流或湖泊溢出并流入街道。
> overflow:vi. 溢出；泛滥；充溢 

And into our homes.

And into our fields.
> fields [ˈfiːldz] 
n. 田地，田野；专业，领域；现场，实地

Water goes and gets higher and higher and higher where water shouldn't be.

So, **water goes where there's not supposed to be water.**
> 所以，水流到不应有水的地方。
not supposed to be 不应该有水的地方
**这句话包含以下语法：**
主谓宾结构
定语从句
存在倒装
= Water goes where it's not supposed to be.


And it gets higher and higher and higher.

That is a flood.

Sometimes floods are just little floods.

But sometimes they're huge floods.

I live in Seoul, South Korea.

This summer, we had a very bad flood.

But nothing like the last two typhoons in the Philippines.

They got really bad floods.

And you can see in the picture the flooding.

Battered, soaked, and flooded.

Battered, soaked, and flooded.

The Philippines.

Now, we always keep the the here.

The Philippines.

Because there are many islands.

And all of these islands together make the country.
> 所有这些岛屿共同组成了这个国家。
> = All these islands together form the country.
= 

It's like the United States.

All of the states together make the United States.

Okay?

Okay?

The Philippines is being hit by, is being hit by, is being hit, is being battered by.

It's second typhoon.

Second.

Now, when you write this word second, you have to write the nd.

Or, just write it like this.

Second.

No.

Second.

And this d sound actually connects to the t.

Second ty.

No.

Second ty.

Second typhoon.

Typhoon.

And we have the ph.

It's an f sound.

The Philippines is being hit by its, by its second typhoon in a week.

Second typhoon in a week.

It's a sad news story, but I think the dictation is not too bad.

So, let's say it together, you and me.

Ready?

One.

Slowly.

Two.

Three.

Battered, soaked, and flooded.

The Philippines is being hit by its second typhoon in a week.

A little bit faster.

Battered, soaked, and flooded.

The Philippines is being hit by its second typhoon in a week.

Great job.

Let's listen to the original audio, and you say it along with the announcer.
 
Battered, soaked, and flooded.

The Philippines is being hit by its second typhoon in a week.

Battered, soaked, and flooded.

The Philippines is being hit by its second typhoon in a week.

Okay.

For Daily Dictation 17, I have a happy story.

It's actually a really cute story.

If you like dogs.

Well, sometimes dogs, they have an owner, but some dogs don't have a home.

They don't have an owner.

We can call them **stray dogs**.
> 我们可以称呼它们为流浪狗。

Well, these dogs usually end up going to an **animal shelter**.
> 如果狗狗在动物收容所，

And if the dogs are at an animal shelter,

they try to give the dogs away,

but usually nobody wants them.

So they put the dogs to sleep.

They kill the dogs.

Euthanasia.
> euthanasia[ˌjuːθəˈneɪziə] n. 安乐死

It's kind of sad.

But,

there's a grandmother in America

who saw these dogs,

who sees these dogs,

and she says,

No!

We're not going to put them to sleep.

I'm going to make them into search and rescue dogs.

So,

there's a tragedy,
> 英 [ˈtrædʒədi] n. 悲惨事件，惨剧；悲剧（作品）；不幸，遗憾；令人非常烦乱（或生气）的情形

like the typhoon in the Philippines or Fukushima,

the nuclear incident,

and the tsunami in Japan,

or an earthquake,

like in Japan,

or in New Zealand,

or in Chile.

She has these dogs,

and they're trained to find people.

It's a beautiful story.

And I've got one sentence,

very short.

It's about the dogs.

So you listen carefully,

and see if you can get the full sentence.

Good luck, everybody.

A few years ago,they were thought to be useless, past their prime.Not now.
> 他们被认为是无用的,过了他们的黄金时期。



# 18

Hey everybody, it's time for Daily Dictation 18, DD 18 and listening comprehension, 
> comprehension 美 [ˌkɑːmprɪˈhenʃ(ə)n] 
n. 理解力，领悟力；（听力或阅读）理解测试；包括，包含

but first we need to **wrap up**, we need to finish Daily Dictation 17.
> 结束

Listen one more time and I'll give you the answers.

A few years ago they were thought to be useless past their prime, not now.
> 几年前，他们被认为是过了巅峰期而毫无用处，但现在不是这样了。
past their prime 过气的，过时的

So how did you do?

Let's **go over** the answers.
> 让我们来回顾答案。

A few years ago.

A few years ago.

Now be careful with this sound.

You do not want to say a few years, you want to say a few years.

My recommendation, when you have this word, this word always connect the sound.

**Try your best to connect your sound.**

Few years.

Each year.

Last year.

First year.

Fifth year.

Just connect the sounds and it will be easy to hear the word year.

Sometimes, for some students, if you say the words separately, it sounds like ear and not

year.

year.

It's a tough sound.

So, a few years.

We have few, so we have to have an S. Connect the sound.

A few years ago.

A few years ago.

Several years ago.

Three years ago.

Three years ago.

Four years ago.

Five years ago.

That's what that means.
> 这就是它的意思。

They. In this case, they refers to the stray dogs.The homeless dogs. 
> 它们。在这种情况下，它们指的是流浪狗。无家可归的狗。

A few years ago, they were thought to be. Thought to be, we can change that. They were, I'll use a different color, considered.


They were considered, they were thought to be useless. Word thought. T-H-O-U-G-H-T. It's an A-W sound. Thought. No, not for American pronunciation. Thought. Kind of drop the chin. Thought.

T-T. Connected. Keep the second sound. Thought-to. No. Thought to. A few years ago, 

**they were thought to be useless. Oh, what a terrible word. Useless.
**

These dogs are useless. Get rid of them. Kill them. We don't want them. That's really sad. 
> 这些狗是无用的。摆脱它们。杀死它们。我们不想要它们。这真的很悲哀。

**Especially** if you like dogs. And we see this straight. Now, sometimes stray dogs are mean.
> 特别是如果你喜欢狗。我们看到这一点。现在，有时流浪狗是凶狠的。
> see this straight 直截了当地
> mean 凶恶的

They're loud. They cause problems. Yes. But not every stray dog. And the story is about the grandmother. And the grandmother, several years ago, she sees these dogs.

And everybody thought, these dogs, they're useless. We have to get rid of them.

Past their prime. Past their prime. Past their prime. Past their. So here we have a T and a TH. We can connect it. Past their. Past their.

But then this S sound is really strong, so pass there, pass there.

It almost sounds like ser, pass there, pass there.

There's a little bit of th, pass there, pass there.

But the faster we say it, pass there, pass there, pass there prime, pass there prime.

There's no th, there's no th, there's no t, there's no th.

You can get rid of it because of the S.

What does pass there prime mean?

Well, look at me.

How old do you think I am?

Yes, that's right.

I'm 27 years old.

No, actually I'm not.

I'm 43 years old.

**But I still feel strong.**

**I feel powerful.**

**I feel creative.**

**I feel active.**

**I feel productive.**

**I'm still in my prime.**

A seven-year-old child, a 15-year-old boy or girl, **they're before their prime.**

Before their prime.

But when you're 17, 18, 19, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, maybe even 50, **you are in your prime.**
> 但当你年龄在17、18、19、25、30、35、40、45，甚至50岁时，你正值壮年。

In your prime.

**The best years of your life.**

**The most productive years of your life.**

But sometimes when we feel depressed, when we feel sad, when we feel down, when we feel useless,
> 但是有时候当我们感到沮丧、悲伤、情绪低落、觉得无用时，

we might say,I'm only 43 years old, 
but I am past my prime.

What are you talking about?

43 is young. 43 is young.

**You're still in your prime.**

And then, of course, when we get older and older and older, we're past our prime.
> 当我们感觉越来越老的时候，我们已经过了最佳时期。

No longer useful.

**No longer productive.**

**Nobody wants you anymore.**

**Well, I don't think there's such an age.**

I don't care if you're 60, 70, 80.

**As long as you're positive and you're productive and you're creative, you are not past your prime.**

We're all pretty good to go, right?

But these dogs, people think they're past their prime.

Get rid of them.

We don't want them.

It's really sad.

So a few years ago, people thought that.

Not now.

Not now.

Things have changed.

**Now we see these dogs as in their prime.**
> 现在我们看到这些狗正值鼎盛时期。

And we can train these dogs to become rescue dogs.

So once again, the story is about search and rescue dogs.

It's a great story.

And there's a link in the description.

Click on the link and you can find the full story.

So let's practice here.

Say it together.

A few years ago, they were thought to be useless.Past their prime.Not now.

One more time.

A few years ago, they were thought to be useless. Past their prime.Not now.

Okay. Daily Dictation 18 and listening comprehension is the same story.

But this time, we're going to listen to the grandmother.

And she has very good advice.

And it kind of talks about this.

Past your prime.

Past one's prime.

If you are feeling that you are past your prime, think again.

Listen to her.

Do the dictation.

And I'll give you the answers next class.

See you, everybody.

If you are breathing, it is not too late. Get up and get going.
> 如果你还在呼吸，现在还不算太晚。起床并开始行动。
> = It's never too late as long as you're breathing.
> = As long as you're breathing, it's never too late.


# 19
Hey everybody, it's Daily Dictation 19, DD19, but first you need to make sure you have the answers for Daily Dictation 18.

Let's listen one more time.

**If you are breathing, it is not too late. Get up and get going.**

Okay, that grandmother has the sweetest voice.

I love her voice and I love her message.

Did you do the dictation?

Did you understand?

Well, here it is.

**If you are breathing, if you are breathing, it is not too late.Get up and get going.**

Ah, I like it.

**So her message is to anybody who is maybe old or very not happy with life, feeling bad about life, very depressed, very lacking of energy.**
> 所以她的信息是针对那些可能年长或对生活非常不满意、感觉糟糕的人。关于生活，非常沮丧，非常缺乏活力。

What do I do?

And she says, "Hey, if you are breathing, I'm breathing, then it is not too late.

It's not too late.

**You can do anything you want.**

If you are breathing, it is not too late. Get up and get going."

Sorry.

Sorry.

So, that's what I'm doing.

I'm teaching English, but I want to teach English to students around the world.

But what can I do?

But I'm breathing, so I should get up and get going.

**And for me, I can use YouTube to help students around the world with their English dictation,pronunciation, understanding.**

**That's why I'm here.**

Her story was after she retired from school.

She was a school teacher and she retired.

Then she started a new life, training **rescue dogs.**

I love this lady.

She's great.

Let's look at the sentence.

If you are breathing.

Now, if you, we can take this F sound and connect it.

So, if you, it sounds like few.

If you, if you are, if you are, if you are, if you are, if you are breathing, breathing, breathing.

There's some vibration.

Breathing, breathing.

If you are breathing.

Breath.

Breath.

B-R-E-A-T-H.

Breath.

No vibration.

Just air.

Breath.

B-R-E-A-T-H-E.

Breathe.

There's vibration.

Breathe.

Breathing.

If you are breathing.

If you are breathing.

If you are breathing.

It is **not too** late.

Not too.

We can just connect the T sounds.

Not too.

It is not too late.

Not too late.

Not too.

Not too.

We can just connect the T sounds.


It is not too late.

Now, we could say it's not too late.

But, why does she say it is and not it's?

To emphasize.

To emphasize.

**To make her point more clear.**
> 为了让她的观点更加清晰。

It's too late.

No, no, no.

It is not too late.

It's stronger.

More emphasis.

It is not too late.

It's not too late.

Too late.

It's done.

It's over.

It's not too late.

It's not done.

It's not over.

You still have time.

Don't give up.

You need to get up and get going.

Get up.

Get up and get going.

**Get off your butt.**
> 站起来。停止懒惰，开始行动

I'll show you my butt.

I can't show you my butt.

Get off your butt.
> 站起来。
= Stand up.
= Get up.

Don't sit down.

Don't lay down.

Get up and get going.

Get going.

Get started.

Start working.

Start doing it.

I love it.

For you out there, English is difficult.
> 对于你们来说，英语很难。

No.

If you are breathing, it is not too late.

Get up and get going.

Do the dictation.

Try the dictation.

If you have questions, ask me questions.

I'm there for you.
> 我会在这里支持你。
= I am here to support you.
= You can count on me.
= I've got your back.

It's a great story.

Let's say it once.

**If you are breathing, it is not too late. Get up and get going.**

Alright.

I'll play the announcer.

Actually, it's the grandmother.

Listen to the grandmother and say it with her.

And then it's DD-19.

**If you are breathing, it is not too late.Get up and get going.** 

If you are breathing, it is not too late.

Get up and get going.

Okay.

Daily dictation 19.

We had a story about a grandmother.

And this time, it's a story about a grandfather.

This is a really lucky grandfather.

He was driving at night on a **mountainous** road.

And a car was coming towards him, but the lights were too bright.

He was like, "Uh, uh."

He couldn't see.

And he drove over the mountain.

200 feet, which is like 65 meters.

But he's okay.

He survived.

He's lucky.

It's a long sentence.

Not too difficult.

Good luck.

And I'll see you next class.

A 67-year-old grandpa has been found alive after being stuck for six days at the bottom of a **ravine**.

# 20

Hey everybody, welcome back to Daily Dictation 20 DD20, but first let's check DD19, the story about **the grandfather who survived a car accident**. 

It was a little difficult. Let's listen one more time. 

A 67-year-old grandpa has been found alive after being stuck for six days at the bottom of a ravine. 
> ravine [rəˈviːn] n. 沟壑，山涧；峡谷

Yes, there are some difficult words. Let's look at it. 

A 67-year-old grandpa has been found alive. That's good. After being stuck for six days, oh my god, at the bottom of a ravine. 

Oh no, that's really scary news. 

This word you might not know. 

Let's go to the top. A 67-year-old grandpa. Grandpa. A 67-year-old, 67-year, when we have this seven year, connect the N sound. 7-year-old, 7-year-old, grandpa. Grandfather, the typical shortened version, 

we don't say "grandfather," we say "grandpa."
