## 3.【复述训练】

请复述这个句子（用英语或日语）：

> **Mother Teresa, who received a Nobel Peace Prize for her work on behalf of the poor, dies in Calcutta, India.**

---
我的：

> Mother Teresa, she was come from India, she died in the age of 87 years old in Calcutta. She received the Nobel Peace Prize because she did lots of work for the poor.

### ✅ **语法检查 (Grammar)**

| 原句 | 修正建议 | 说明 |
|------|-----------|------|
| **she was come from India** | ❌ → **she came from India** <br>✅ or **she was from India** | “was come” is incorrect. Use either simple past “came” or "was from". |
| **she died in the age of 87 years old** | ❌ → **she died at the age of 87** | “at the age of 87” is the correct expression. Don’t say “in the age” and avoid repeating “years old” here. |
| **because she did lots of work for the poor** | ✔️语法上没问题，但更自然是：<br>**she did a lot of work for the poor** | “lots of work” 是口语常用，但 “a lot of work” 更中性自然。 |

---

### 💬 **自然表达 (Fluency & Style)**

你的句子表达很清晰，但有一些小调整可以让整体听起来更像“自然口语”或书面表达：

### ✨ 推荐的自然版本：

> **Mother Teresa was from India. She died at the age of 87 in Calcutta. She received the Nobel Peace Prize for her work helping the poor.**

或者更正式一点的版本：

> **Mother Teresa, who was from India, died in Calcutta at the age of 87. She received the Nobel Peace Prize for her work on behalf of the poor.**

# 002(0429/)
Mother Teresa, who received a Nobel Peace Prize for her work on behalf of the poor, dies in Calcutta, India. She was 87 years old.

So, how did you do on the first dictation? Well, once again, that came from AP Associated Press, their history, and the answer was: 

Mother Teresa, who received a Nobel Peace Prize for her work on behalf of the poor,dies in Calcutta, India. She was 87 years old. 

**Did you get it?** 100%? Let's practice here.

Mother Teresa, Mother Teresa, Mother Teresa, Mother Teresa.

Usually, in America, we say Teresa. Teresa is great, perfect. Usually in America, Teresa. Mother Teresa, who received a, who received? Mother Teresa, who received? She received something. She received something. She got something. She gained something.

Received a, Now In this case, this D sound connect,received, received,  a Nobel Peace Prize.

Wow! Excellent. She received the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1979, she received the Nobel Peace Prize. Why? Why did she get the Nobel Peace Prize? For. For what? For her work. Ah, so she was working on the something. 


For her work. Now, the pronunciation, when we say fast. For her work. For her work. And we got to connect. For her work on. In America, we say on. On. We don't usually say on. We say on. For her work on. Behalf of. For her work on. Behalf of.
> 代表（on behalf of）；因为，为了……的利益（in/on behalf of）

And we connect again.

Now, we connect again. Behalf of. Now, what does this mean for her work. On Behalf of. 

For her work, on Behalf of. We could also say for. So, instead of on Behalf of, We could say for. For her work on. Behalf of. For her work. For.
> on behalf of = for

Who? The poor. The poor. The poor. People with no money. People with bad housing. People who don't have.

have a lot of goods, a lot of material goods. Good food, good house, good clothes. 

So Mother Theresa worked for those people. She did things for those people. And because of that,

she received a prize. What prize? The Nobel Peace Prize. That's great.

Anyway, the sentence once again, Mother Theresa dies in Calcutta, India. Now, usually we should think past tense.

Mother Theresa died, died in Calcutta, India. But in Associated Press history, 

when they tell you the history, it's like going back in time. So you're living at that point. 
> 就像回到过去一样。所以你就生活在那个时刻
= When I tell you the history, it feels like going back in time, as if you are living in that moment.
going back in time(回到过去); living at that point(生活在那个时刻)

So she dies in Calcutta, India. **On this day, back in history**, she dies where? In Calcutta, India.
> 在这一天，回到历史上

Calcutta, India. And how old was she? She was 87 years old. 87 years old. 87 years old. 

87 years old. So let's say it slowly. Say it with me.

Mother Theresa, who received a Nobel Peace Prize for her work on behalf of the poor, 

dies in Calcutta, India. She was 87 years old. Let's try it again a little bit faster. Mother Theresa,

who received a Nobel Peace Prize for her work on behalf of the poor, dies in Calcutta, India.

She was 87 years old. One more time. Mother Theresa, who received a Nobel Peace Prize for her work on behalf

of the poor, dies in Calcutta, India. She was 87 years old. So our first dictation was difficult. It was very long.

It was very long. But the next dictation is really short. It's actually two sentences. Very short.

Two sentences. It's from the **situation comedy(情景喜剧)**, Seinfeld. And it's George, the character George, and the character Jerry.

George asks a question. Jerry gives the answer. That's the next dictation. Dictation number two. Listen, dictate it, and come back tomorrow for the answers.

Good luck, everybody.

Jerry, what time do you have? I have five o'clock.

## 📘 2. 【语法总结】

这段听写中出现了多个关键语法点，我们来详细总结一下：

### ① **定语从句**
- **解释**：修饰前面的名词，提供更多信息。
- **结构**：主句 + 名词 + who/which/that + 动词…
- **例句**：*Mother Teresa, who received a Nobel Peace Prize, dies in Calcutta.*
- ✅ *who received a Nobel Peace Prize* 是修饰 *Mother Teresa* 的定语从句。

---

### ② **现在时用于“历史时刻”描述**
- **解释**：新闻或历史文体中**常用现在时讲述过去事件**，增加临场感。
- **结构**：主语 + 一般现在时动词
- **例句**：*She dies in Calcutta, India.*（虽然是过去发生，但用现在时）
- ✅ 类似表达：*On this day in history, the war ends.*（战争结束）

---

### ③ **省略句与强调句式**
- **解释**：口语中常通过反复、省略、重读等手段强调信息。
- **例句**：*Who? The poor. The poor.* → 强调“穷人”是谁
- ✅ 这是在口语中非常常见的“打断+重复”方式，增强记忆和理解

---

## 🔁 3. 【复述训练】

> Jerry, what time do you have? I have five o'clock.

---

### ✅ **语法修正与更自然的表达**

| 你写的句子 | 修正建议 | 原因说明 |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Someone don't have a watch.** | ✅ **Someone doesn't have a watch.** | 主语是 “someone”（单数），助动词用 “doesn’t” |
| **He don't know what time is it.** | ✅ **He doesn't know what time it is.** | 语法错误：从句中语序应为“what time it is” |
| **So, she asked Jerry the time.** | ✅ 取决于你要说的人是“he”还是“she”，要一致。比如改成：**So, he asked Jerry the time.** |
| **Jerry, what time is it?** | ✅ 保留原句没问题。可以说是“he asked, ‘Jerry, what time is it?’”更自然。 |
| **Jerry answered his question is 5 o'clock.** | ✅ 更自然是：**Jerry answered that it was five o'clock.** 或者 **He said it was five o'clock.** |

---

### 💬 **润色后的自然版本（推荐复述）**

> Someone didn’t have a watch and didn’t know what time it was. So, he asked Jerry, “What time is it?” Jerry answered that it was five o’clock.

或者更口语化一点：

> One person didn’t have a watch and didn’t know the time. He asked Jerry, “What time is it?” Jerry told him, “It’s five o’clock.”

# 003(0429/)
Jerry, what time do you have?

I have five o'clock.

Okay, dictation number two.

Was it easy for you? 
> 对你来说容易吗？

She is easy to get along with（她很容易相处）
This game is easy to pick up（这个游戏很容易上手）

Well, George had the first line, George from Seinfeld 
> 乔治说了第一句台词

and he says, Jerry, what time do you have?
> = He asks Jerry, "What time is it?"
= He asks Jerry, "What's the time?"
= He asks Jerry for the time.

And then Jerry responded, I have five o'clock.

**Did you get it?**

Great, great.

Now, a lot of students, I know, do have some problems.

What time do you have?

What time do you have?

What time do you have?

What time?

Now, we got two sounds, sound the same.
> Wha**t t**ime

We connect the sounds, and we only keep the second one.

What time?

No.

What time?

What time do you have?

What time do you have?

Do you.

The faster we say it, the you gets shorter.

Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you.

Dab, dab.

And this word, have, and this word, have, there's a pronunciation rule.

I call it the seven H's.**The seven H's.**

And the words are, **he, her, him, his, had, has, and have.**

Now, these words are **very common** in daily English.

And a lot of native speakers, especially Americans, when we say it fast, when we speak quickly, **we can't hear the H sound.**

Okay, the H's cancel.

Okay?

The H's canceled. It's a cancellation.

So, do you have, if we say it fast, do you have?

Do you have, do you have, do you have?

Do you have?

Jerry, what time do you have?

Jerry, what time do you have?

When we say it slow, Jerry, what time do you have?

Jerry, what time do you have?

And then Jerry says, I have five o'clock.

And if we say it quickly, once again, we can **get rid of** the H sound.
> 我们可以去掉H的发音.
= If we say it quickly again, we can **eliminate (ɪˈlɪmɪˌneɪt)** the H sound.

I have five o'clock.
> 省略掉 h，I ve five o'clock.

I have five o'clock.

Now, there's another link.

We have a V sound here.

And five, it's an F sound, right?

So, when we have similar sounds, we connect the sound and only keep this one.

Just like, what to time?

No.

What time?

Have five?

No.

Have five.

I have five o'clock.

I have five o'clock.

Now, the key, everybody, when you're speaking English,.

**Say it like a human**.

What time do you have?

That's okay.

Or you could look at your watch.

Oh, **my watch is not working** .

What time do you have?

And then you've got to check your watch.

Oh, you check your phone or check your watch.

I have five o'clock.

I have five o'clock.

What time do you have?

Do you have five o'clock?

Well, that was today's dictation or yesterday's dictation.

And today we have a brand new one.
> 今天我们有一个全新的.
I bought a brand new car yesterday.(全新的)

It's one sentence. It's not too difficult.

**Are you familiar with** Snoopy or Charlie Brown?

Well, Charlie Brown has a friend.

And his name is Linus.

Linus is the character with the blanket.
> blanket 英 [ˈblæŋkɪt]  美 [ˈblæŋkɪt]  n. 毯子，毛毯

Linus **has something good to say**.
> Linus 有一句不错的话要分享。
= Linus is always full of great insights.
> **听到朋友说了句很有道理的话：** You have something good to say.	你说得真有道理。
> **想介绍某人的金句：** He has something good to say about life.	他对人生有一番独到的见解。
**类似句型：** I have something important to tell you.

You listen, do the dictation, and I'll give you the answer tomorrow.

Thanks a lot.

**There are three things I have learned never to discuss with people: religion, politics, and the great pumpkin.**

Thank you.

# 004(0429/)

**There are three things I have learned never to discuss with people:Religion, politics, and the great pumpkin.**
 
So, dictation three, was it difficult?

Yeah, I think the middle section may have been a little bit difficult.

Well, Linus, this is what he said.

There are three things I have learned never to discuss with people.

Religion, politics, and the great pumpkin.

Okay, let's go to the top here.
> 好的，让我们回到开头这里。
= Sure, let's head to the top.

There are three things.

There are.

There are.

There are.

Get the pronunciation.

These R's are important.

And we have a connection.

There are.

Now we got THTH.

So this first sentence is difficult for some students.

There are three things.

What?

I have learned.

Now, we studied this **the other day**.
> 我们前几天学过这个. the other day(固定短语，“几天前、前几天”)
= We went over this the other day.
**类似句子:**
We talked about it the other day.	我们前几天谈过这件事。
You showed me this the other day.	你前几天给我看过这个。
Didn’t we go there the other day?	我们不是前几天去过那里吗？
We went over this the other day. “我们前几天复习/讲解/讨论过这个。”

There's no H sound.

If we say it fast, the H is gone.

There is an A sound.

There is the A sound.

I have. I have learned.

I have learned.

There are three things I have learned.

There are three things I have learned.

There are three things I have learned.

There are three things I have learned never.

Now, I made this a capital N.

It should be a small N.

But it's emphasized.

We have to emphasize this word.

We have to say it powerfully.

There are three things I have learned never to discuss.

To.

This word has seven different sounds.

**We can say to, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, da, ta, ta, ta.**

The most common sounds for Americans are going to be ta and ta.

Ta and ta.

When we say it quickly.

So, in this case, never to discuss.

Never to discuss.

Never ta.

Ta.

It's like a T-U-H ta.

No.

Ta.

It's more of a schwarz.

It's a very short sound.

Ta.

Never to discuss.

Never to discuss with.

We can connect the sound.

Discuss with people.

There are three things I have learned to never discuss.

Whoops.

I'm backwards.

There are three things I have learned never to discuss with people.

There are three things I have learned never to discuss with people.

Say it with me.
> 跟我一起说。
= Repeat after me.
= Let's say it together.

There are three things I have learned never to discuss with people.

A, B, and C.

Three things.

Number one.

Religion.

Do not discuss religion with people.

Yeah.

Linus is what? Six years old?

And he knows this? What a genius.

Politics.

Never discuss politics with people.

Wow.

And number three.

The great pumpkin. The great pumpkin.

**What the hell is he talking about?**
> 他到底在说什么？

Let's talk about this one more time.

There are three things I have learned never to discuss with people, religion, politics, and the great pumpkin.

You want to know what the great pumpkin is?

Well, do you know Santa Claus? Santa Claus.

Yes.

Most, many, many children around the world believe in Santa Claus. Right?

And Santa Claus is the character, the person who comes on Christmas, December 25th.

Okay?

Well, in America and some other countries, we have a holiday called Halloween, which is October 31st.

The evening of October 31st.

And Linus believes that, like Santa Claus, there's a great pumpkin that comes and delivers gifts to the children who believe.

Unfortunately, only Linus **believes in** the great pumpkin.

So, if he talks about the great pumpkin, other people think he's crazy.

So, he doesn't talk about the great pumpkin.

Well, that's, anyway, that's the sentence today.

Alright?

Let's listen to the audio one more time and try and say it together.

There are three things I have learned never to discuss with people.

Religion, politics, and the great pumpkin.

Well, we're ready for dictation number four.
> 我们准备好了第四篇听写了。
= We are prepared for the fourth dictation.

And dictation number four is from the movie, The Pursuit of Happiness.
> 第四篇听写来自电影《当幸福来敲门》 (pursuit 追求)

The Pursuit of Happiness starring Will Smith.
> 《当幸福来敲门》由威尔·史密斯主演。
= Will Smith stars in The Pursuit of Happiness.
starring 英 [stɑː(r)ɪŋ]  美 [ˈstɑːrɪŋ] adj. 最重要的演员的 v. 扮演主角，领衔主演；

And this is one of Will Smith's famous lines.
> 这是威尔·史密斯的一句名言。
= Here is a famous line from Will Smith.

It's a great line.
> 这是一句很棒的台词。
= That's an excellent line.
= It's a fantastic line.

**But your mission is to dictate it.**

Listen to the pronunciation.

Try it one time.

Daily Dictation 5 Hello everybody, welcome back to Daily Dictation 5.

But first of all, you need the answers for Daily Dictation 4.
> 首先，你需要 Daily Dictation 4 的答案。
= Firstly, / To begin with, / Before anything else,

Listen one more time.

Don't ever let somebody tell you, you can't do something.
> can't 的t不发音，something发音为somemmm鼻音

So did you get the answer?

This is it.

Don't ever let somebody tell you, you can't do something.

Don't ever let somebody tell you, you can't do something.

If Will Smith said it like that, it would be easy.

But he says it a little faster.

So let's practice.

Don't ever let, don't ever let somebody tell you.

Don't ever.

**There's a very important pronunciation rule.**

It's for cancellation.

**And it works especially with American English.**
> 这在美式英语中尤为重要。
= It works particularly well with American English.
= It is particularly effective with American English.

There are three strong sounds.

The strong sounds are the S, N, and L.

And there are three weak sounds.

The weak sounds are D, T, and TH.

And what this means, if there's a D, T, TH next to an S, an N, or an L, many times this sound is cancelled.

So you know the expression U and I, U and I.

We don't say U and I, we say U and I, U and I.

The N cancels the D and then we connect the N sound.

International.

International is perfect, but usually we say international. International.
> 发音注意！

The N kills the T. International.

And here we have don't ever, don't ever.

Here the N cancels the T.

And we connect the N sound.

Don't ever.

Don't ever let. Don't ever let. Don't ever let.

The sound stops.

Let, you don't have to say let, let.

Let.

Let.

Don't ever let somebody tell you.

Don't ever let somebody tell you.

Don't ever.

Never do it.

Don't ever let.

Never let.

Never do something.

Never what?

Let means allow.

Don't ever allow somebody.

Don't ever allow somebody what?

Tell you.

Don't ever let somebody tell you.

If somebody says something something to you, stop.

Don't ever let somebody tell you what?

You, again we had you, can't do something.

Can't do.

We don't say can't do.

Once again, the N cancels the T.

Can't do.

So it's like can't, we gotta stop.

Can't do.

Can't do something. Can't do something.

But listen to the word something carefully.

He doesn't say something.

He says something.

Somnnn.

**注意发音规则：**
And what's interesting, in daily English, we have a spelling and the spelling is S-U-M-P apostrophe N. And we'll try it. Suk-un, suk-pun, no. Suk-un, suk-un, at the P you've got to stop. And then N, suk-un, suk-un, suk-un, suk-un.

Don't ever let somebody tell you, you can't do something. If somebody says, you can't do that, stop them. Don't ever let them. Don't ever let people tell you, you can't do something. 

You can do it. You can do it. You've got the power. You've got the ability. Don't ever let somebody tell you, you can't do something.

Don't ever let, don't ever let, the N cancel the T, somebody tell you, don't ever let somebody tell you, you can't do something.

And something, if we say it really fast, something, something, something, something. So what happens in the mouth, some, close the mouth, some, and then, n, n, just make the N sound.

But you can close your lips. Suk-un, suk-un, suk-un. So it's basically like an M. But we write it with an N.

Don't ever let somebody tell you, you can't do something. Don't ever let somebody tell you, you can't do something.

Use the body language. Don't ever let somebody tell you, you can't do something.

**注意发音，连音：**
Don't ever let somebody tell you, you can't do something. Okay?

Don't ever let somebody tell you, you can't do something.

Don't ever let somebody tell you, you can't do something.

Well, that was the Will Smith In Pursuit of Happiness line.

And I've got another line from another movie.

This is an old movie. It's kind of funny, kind of scary( [ˈskeəri] 骇人的，恐怖的).

The movie's title is They Live.

And the line is really famous.

It's very popular. It's kind of funny line.

It's kind of like an Arnold Schwarzenegger style line.

So listen to the dictation, listen to the audio, and do your best at the dictation.

Okay? Good luck, everybody.

I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass.
> 这是一种 带有幽默感的强势宣战台词，最早来自电影《They Live》。
我来这里只为了嚼泡泡糖和开打，而现在泡泡糖已经嚼完了！
> "And I’m all out of bubblegum."
“我已经没泡泡糖了” = 接下来就是开打了！

And I'm all out of bubble gum.
> 我已经没有泡泡糖了。(all out of 没有了)
= I have run out of bubble gum.
= I'm out of bubble gum.

# 006
Hey everybody, it's Daily Dictation 6, but let's listen to yesterday's dictation one more time.

I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass, and I'm all out of bubblegum.

So, how did you do?

Did you think it was funny?

Did you understand it?

I hope so.

Once again, that line is from the movie "They Live".

It's an alien kind of cool kind of movie from a long time ago.
> 这是一部来自很久以前的外星人风格的酷炫电影。
= It's a cool and distinctive movie from the past.

Anyway, the sentence, I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass, and I'm all out of bubblegum.

Okay.

I have come here.

Nothing difficult.
> 没有什么困难的。
= Nothing too challenging.
例：Completing this task is nothing difficult; it just requires a bit of focus and attention.

There's no cancellations.

Just that way.

Repeat.

I have come here.

Why have I come here?

Why?

I have come here for two reasons.
> 我来这里有两个原因。 
= I am here for two reasons.
= I have two reasons for being here.

Two reasons.

Two reasons.

Number one and number two.

The first reason, I have come here to chew bubblegum.

That's right.

Not just any kind of gum.
> 不只是任何一种口香糖。
= Not any ordinary gum.

Bubblegum.

So, I have come here to chew bubblegum.

That's a stupid reason to go someplace.
> = It's ridiculous to go there for that reason.

Do you go someplace special to chew bubblegum?
> 你会去特别的地方嚼泡泡糖吗？
go someplace special : 去某个特别的地方

Well, that's his first reason.

Well, that's his first reason.

I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.

What does kick ass mean?

It means, "Wha, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom." Killing people.

Beating people up.

Hitting people.

That's the idea.
> 就是这个意思。
例：Do you have any idea about this?

To kill the aliens.

The lizard people.

I have come here to chew bubblegum.

Now, the pronunciation, there's **one slight difficult part** right here.
> 现在，发音方面，这里有一个稍微困难的部分。
例：Now, the pronunciation has **one slightly tricky part** here.

I have come here to, come here to.

When we talk about the word "to," I tell my students there's seven different sounds.

So, just repeat.

There's "to," there's "ta," "tuh," "tuh," "da," "duh," "duh." We say all of these sounds.

"Tuh," "tuh," "tuh," "tuh," "da," "duh," "duh." 

The most common sound is not "to." It really depends on the situation.
> 它真的取决于情况。
发音规则，一般不把 to 发成 two 这个音，而是te

Here we have "here to." Here to.

Well, if you practice all seven different sounds and say it quickly, The most convenient, the easiest sound to say is "here to." Here to.
> 发音：here d饿

So it sounds like a "duh," "duh," "duh." Here to.

I have come here to chew bubblegum.

I have come here to chew bubblegum.

Here to chew bubblegum.

And kick ass.

There's no "d" sound.

"N-duh," "kick ass." No.

There's no "d." The "n" kills the "d." We studied that earlier.

Then there's a **pause**.

And I'm all out of bubblegum.

And I'm all out of bubblegum.

So here we once again.

The "n" kills the "d." And...

And now we've got to connect.

"I'm." But we don't say "I'm." We almost always say "am." "Am." So it's like **phonetically** "A-H-M." You have to connect the sound.
> phonetically [fəˈnetɪkli] adv. 语音学上；按照发音地

"An-am." "An-am." "An-am." We've got to keep connecting.

Connect.

Connect.

Every time there's no consonant, we need to connect.

"An-am-all." "An-am-all." Keep going.

"I'm all out of." "I'm all out of bubblegum." Now, another important pronunciation point.

"Out of" has a special spelling for daily English.

And we spell it O-U-T-T-A.
> out of 发音规则

Because the typical pronunciation is not "out of," we say "a-ta." "A-ta." "A-ta." "O-ta?" 

No, we don't even say "a-ta." "A-ta." "A-ta." "I'm all out of bubblegum." "And I'm all out of bubblegum." 

"And I'm all out of bubblegum." 

"I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass." "Pfff, pfff, pfff, pfff." "And I'm all out of bubblegum." What does that mean?

"I'm all out of bubblegum." "I have no more bubblegum." "I have zero bubblegum." 
> **I have no more bubblegum**

"So, why is he here to kick ass?" "Pfff, pfff, pfff, pfff." "Pfff, pfff, pfff." 

**"It's a funny expression."**

"And we use it sometimes in daily English." "If there's a test and you go into the test center, I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.

And I'm all out of bubblegum." **In this case, it means you're going to kick ass on the test**.
> 在这种情况下，"我已经没有泡泡糖了。" 这意味着你将在考试中表现出色。

So, kick ass on somebody means to fight them, to shoot them, to kill them.

But, to kick ass on a test means to do a really good job on the test.
> 但是，在考试中"踢屁股"意味着在考试中做得非常出色。

Or, let's say it's a marathon.

**A marathon, so you came to kick ass in the marathon.**
> 马拉松，所以你来参加马拉松是要表现出色的。
> = You're ready to crush the marathon.

**It means to do really, really well at the marathon.**

Okay?

It is a good expression.

Lots of good expressions here.

We got the expression kick ass, all out of something something, and the pronunciation points.

So, today's was a little bit difficult, a little bit long.

But tomorrow's is easy.

But first of all, let's listen to today's dictation number five two more times.

And then we'll move to dictation number six.

"I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.And I'm all out of bubblegum." 

Okay, I hope your repetition was good.

Now, we're moving into dictation number six.

This is from my favorite show, Seinfeld.

It's a situation comedy.
> 这是一部情景喜剧。
= It's a sitcom.

And this is **a bit of wisdom** from the character, Kramer.
> 这是来自角色克莱默的一点智慧。

If you know Kramer, he's a genius.

Not, "Oh, I got a mosquito.

**Why do I have** so many mosquitoes in my house?" **I didn't get it.**
> 为什么我家里有这么多蚊子？我不明白。

I'll get it later.
> 我会明白的。
= I'll grab it later.

Enjoy the audio, and I'll give you the answers tomorrow.

See ya!

The secret of life is just to live every moment.
> 生活的秘密就是活在当下。
= The key to life is simply living in the moment.
= Living in the moment is the secret to life.

## 📌 补充学习建议：

### 📢 发音重点复习：
- **“to” 的发音变化**：ta / tuh / duh / etc.（"come here to" → 类似 "come here duh"）
- **“out of” → outta**：I'm all outta bubblegum
- **连读练习**：And I'm all out of → An-am-all-outta

### 🎬 文化背景：
- “I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass” 是电影 *They Live* 中的名台词，有点讽刺+酷炫，是一种“装逼式”的表达方式，现实生活中可以幽默地引用，比如：
  - 进入考试前说：“I’m all out of bubblegum.”（意思是“我要全力以赴”）

## 复述

**“I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass”**

> OK, this sentence is full of wisdom. This sentence tells us the secret of life is just a mere moment. If you can live every moment, you will live a very meaningful life. This is a really good sentence.

---

### ✅ 1. 语法检查 (Grammar)
整体语法是正确的，没有重大错误。不过有个句子稍微不够精确，可以优化表达：

- ❗ **原句**：  
  *“The secret of life is just a mere moment.”*  
  这个句子意思有点偏了。原句强调的是“活在每一个时刻”，而不是“人生的秘密就是一个时刻”。  
  🛠 **改进建议**：  
  - "The secret of life is to live each moment fully."  
  - 或者："The secret of life lies in cherishing every single moment."

---

### ✅ 2. 句子自然度 (Naturalness)

除了上面那一句稍有歧义，其它表达都很自然。以下几句尤其好：

- ✅ *“This sentence is full of wisdom.”* — 很自然的评价句。
- ✅ *“If you can live every moment, you will live a very meaningful life.”* — 简洁且有哲理。
- ✅ *“This is a really good sentence.”* — 表达了你对这句话的赞赏，非常地道。

---

### ✅ 3. 表达流畅度 (Fluency & Clarity)

整体表达非常流畅，逻辑顺序清晰，能自然地传达你的想法和理解。

---

### ✨ 推荐的复述版本（参考）：
你可以参考下面这种稍加润色的复述：

> This sentence is full of wisdom. It reminds us that the secret of life is to live fully in each and every moment. If we focus on the present, our lives will become more meaningful. I really like this idea.

# 007(0429/)

Hey everybody, it's Daily Dictation 7, but first, let's listen to yesterday's one more time.

The secret of life is just to live every moment.

So, that was Kramer from Seinfeld.

Did you get it?
> 你明白了吗？
= Have you understood?

The answer is, the secret of life is just to live every moment.

The secret of life is just to live every moment.

It's good advice. The secret of life.

Nothing too difficult, the secret of life, the secret.

Now, in American English, when we don't have a consonant, we've got to connect.
> consonant [ˈkɒnsənənt] n. 辅音；辅音字母

Secret of life.

Secret of life.

## 复述

**German Rolf Buchholz Is the man with the most Piercings. He's got 453.**
> 

# 009

Hello everybody, welcome back to Dictation #9, but first of all, let's listen one more time to yesterday's Daily Dictation.
 
German Rolf Buchholz is the man with the most piercings. He's got 453.

So how was it? 
> 那么，怎么样？

Man, Rolf Buchholz. The guy is interesting. Wow. Do you have any piercings?
> 你有任何穿孔吗？

I know a lot of ladies have pierced ears, but if you look, I have no piercings.

I'm thinking about getting a piercing though. I'd like to get a piercing. I'd like to pierce my ear.
> though [ðəʊ] conj. 虽然，尽管；可是，不过

Maybe when I'm older, like 70 years old and I'm fat and completely bald, then I'll get a piercing in my ear.
> bald  [bɔːld] adj. 秃头的；光秃的，磨光的，掉光的；不加修饰的，直截了当的

And my nose. And my eyebrow. And my lip. But not my tongue.
> 我的鼻子。我的眉毛。我的嘴唇。但不要我的舌头。
eyebrow [ˈaɪbraʊ] 

What about you? Are you pierced? Eh. Actually, I don't want to know.

Alright, here are the answers. German Rolf Buchholz. German. Oh, the first word is difficult. German Rolf Buchholz.

German Rolf Buchholz. American Shane Peterson. American Shane Peterson.

That's the idea. Just put the country adjective in front and then the person's name. German Rolf Buchholz.

Now, I apologize to any German listeners, if there are any. I don't know the proper pronunciation.

This is the American style pronunciation. Rolf Buchholz. Is that proper in German? I hope so.

Is the man with the most piercings. Is the man with the most piercings.

Now, the faster we say this sentence, is the, this z sound will cancel the th.

And if we say it really fast, it sounds like, is the, is the man, is the man, is the man, is the man.

So this actually can sound like z, u, h. Is the. Is the man, is the man, is the man.

With the. Now we have similar sounds. This is an aspirated th, with, and this is a vibrated th. With the. With the. With the.
> aspirated [ˈæspəreɪtɪd] adj. 送气音的

So they're not the same sounds, but they're similar sounds. And when we have similar sounds next to each other, we can connect it and just keep the second sound.
> with the 保留第二个th的音

With the. With the. With the. With the. With the. It's, it's gonna be the vibrated th that we keep. With the. With the. With the.

German Rolf Buchholz is the man with the most piercings. Now, same thing here. Here we have the s, the z sound, killing the th. And here, we have the s, killing the t sound.

If we say it quickly. Most piercings. **Most piercings. There's no t at all**. Zero. No t. We should though, proper pronunciation, most piercings. Most piercings. Most piercings. Most piercings.

No t. Piercings. Piercings. Piercings. Wow. Mmm. He's got. He's got. He has got. This, of course, is a has. He's got. Four hundred fifty three. Four hundred fifty three.

Four hundred fifty three. Now, the proper way to read this number is. Four hundred fifty three. 

However, many Americans will say. Four hundred and fifty three. Four hundred and fifty three.

Four hundred and fifty three. However, many Americans will say. Four hundred and fifty three. Four hundred and fifty three. But actually we shouldn't have the and.

"and". Just put the numbers together: "453". "453". "453". And one more interesting. Sometimes,

the word "hundred" actually sounds like "hundred". "453". "453". "4 hundred"? No. 

**Let me write it out for you**. So the word is actually "hundred". But many times when we say it fast, it sounds like
> 所以我给你写出来。实际上这个词是"hundred"。但是很多时候当我们快速说的时候，听起来像

"hundred". "453". "453". "453". "453". "453". "453". 

So the faster we say this word, we actually do this. And what happens here is the
> 所以我们说这个词越快，实际上就是这样。这里发生的是

"n" cancels the "d". And then this "r" and "e" **get reversed**. They **get changed around**.
> "n"取消了"d"。然后这个"r"和"e"被颠倒了。它们被改变了位置。

And then once again, if you ask an American, a native English speaker, "do you do that?"

They'll probably say, "no". I always say "400". "400". But if you listen, if you listen to sitcoms and listen to movies and listen to native, especially American English speakers,

"hundred". When they say it quickly, it sounds like "400". "400". "400". Okay? So let's read it again.

"German Rolf Buchholz is the man with the most piercings". He's got "453".

Try and say it with me together. You ready? One, two, three.

"German Rolf Buchholz is the man with the most piercings". He's got "453".

Now, We are going to move on to the dictation number nine, before we go, you listen and watch the pretty picture of Mr Buchholz.

"German Rolf Buchholz is the man with the most piercings". He's got "453".

"Okay, now, daily dictation number nine. If you've been watching the news, you may have heard about the satellite, the weather satellite owned by NASA, which is falling to the earth. Here's the picture.

"Yeah, this is as big as a bus and it's falling to the earth". **That's scary.** 
> 这很可怕

They say the satellite will break up into about 24 pieces, 24 big pieces as it falls to the earth. 
> 将会分裂成大约24块碎片，24块大碎片随着它落向地球。

They say that the chances of getting hit by a piece is 1 in 3200. 1 in 3200. So, somebody might get hit. I hope not. Oh god,
> 被碎片击中的概率是3200分之1。3200分之1。所以，有人可能会被击中。希望不会。天啊。

I absolutely hope not. That'll kill somebody. They say the only place where you will not get hit is

Antarctica. Well, that doesn't help. And they say that the satellite will fall to earth.
> Antarctica [ænˈtɑːktɪkə]  美 [ænˈtɑːrktɪkə]  n. 南极洲

Earth on about September 23rd. September 23rd. So, today is September 20th. So,

could be September 22nd. Could be September 24th. Probably September 23rd. They don't know where.

I hope I don't get hit. I hope you don't get hit. I hope nobody gets hit. But it'll be **pretty exciting**.
> 我希望我不会被击中。我希望你不会被击中。我希望没有人会被击中。但这将会非常令人兴奋。
= I hope none of us get hit, but it'll be quite exciting.

Okay, so the satellite is coming to earth and you've got to do some dictation. Once again,

this is from AP News. I love AP News, Associated Press. They are on YouTube. Just go to Associated Press,

the channel, and you can listen to this full story and many, many, many other great news stories. 

So,thank you to AP News. Listen to the sentence. Do your best. And I will see you tomorrow, tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow.

It's only a day away.

A satellite that was carried to space aboard the shuttle Discovery 20 years ago is about to fall to earth, but nobody knows where the debris will hit.
> 20年前搭载在发现号航天飞机上的卫星即将坠落到地球上。但是没有人知道碎片会落在哪里。



# 010

Hello again, welcome back to Dictation Number 10.

But first of all, let's double check Dictation Number 9.

Did you get the dictation about the satellite?

Listen again.

A satellite that was carried to space aboard the shuttle Discovery 20 years ago

was about to fall to Earth, but nobody knows where the debris will hit.

Wow, that was a long one.

Yeah, that was a very long one, lots of words, too many words.

So what I did is right now I put half the answer up.

So let's practice the first half of the answer.

You ready?

A satellite, a satellite.

You know the word satellite?

**Up in space**, the satellites, weather satellite, communications satellite, spy satellite.
> 在太空中，卫星，气象卫星，通信卫星，间谍卫星。

Astronomical telescope satellite.
> astronomical [ˌæstrəˈnɒmɪk(ə)l]  adj. 天文（学）的，天体的；（数量、价格或收费）天文数字的，极其巨大的
telescope [ˈtelɪskəʊp] n. 望远镜；射电望远镜，


Many different satellites in space.

A satellite, one satellite.

A satellite that was.

A satellite that.

A satellite that.

So we have a T and a TH.

Put it together.

Just keep this.

A satellite that was.

A satellite that was.

Carried to space.

Carried to space.

Carried to.

Now, the to is going to sound more like a T. Carried to space.

Carried to space.

Carried to space.

A satellite that was carried to space.

So a satellite cannot go to space by itself.

It cannot go to space on its own.

A satellite needs to be inside a rocket.

Or inside the space shuttle.

In America we have the space shuttle.
> 在美国，我们有航天飞机。

It looks like.... Wow! No? Alright. Anyway, we got the... I don't know what the hell that is. It's my space shuttle. It's a terrible picture. I'm not an artist. 

Anyway, so carried to space. How was it carried to carry something?

And I'm carrying these magic markers. How was it carried to space? In a rocket or in the space shuttle? Let's see. A satellite that was carried to space, carried to space aboard the shuttle. Space shuttle discovery. Which shuttle discovery?

So, aboard. Aboard. That means to be riding something. To be on something. Aboard a train. Aboard a plane. Aboard a ship. Aboard the shuttle.
> 所以，在船上。在船上。这意味着乘坐某物。在某物上。在火车上。在飞机上。在船上。在航天飞机上。
aboard 在...之上，在...之内 在某种交通工具上

The space shuttle. Now, once again, we have these similar sounds. D-T-H. Aboard the... Aboard the... Aboard the shuttle. Aboard the shuttle discovery.

Discovery. Discovery. Discovery. A satellite that was carried to space aboard the shuttle Discovery. When? When was it carried to space? 

20 years ago. The word is 20. 20. But the pronunciation is 20. And the reason is, is this N sound is strong. And it cancels out the T. Perfect pronunciation. 20. But the typical pronunciation. 20.

20 years. 20 years. 20 years. Put the sounds together. You don't want to say 20 years. No. 20 years. 20 years ago. 20 years ago.
> twenty years -> tweny years

20 years ago. This is the first half. A satellite that was carried to space aboard the shuttle Discovery. 20 years ago. A satellite that was carried to space aboard the shuttle Discovery. 20 years ago.
